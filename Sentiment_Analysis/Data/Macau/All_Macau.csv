The decor is lovely, manager is attentive and cute, food is on point!
I would definitely revisit this restaurant if I get to visit Macau again."
2,Globetrotterstar1966,Ittigen,Switzerland,12-August-2019,"When we stayed at the Strip in Macau, we wanted to eat once Beijing duck, traditional style. We asked some for a good address and we got it. We enjoyed a wonderful duck at this great restaurant for a very reasonable price. We loved the wonderful food. The personel was very nice. We recommend this restaurant for that kind of special dinner."
3,Shelley P,None,None,26-June-2019,"Visited on the last night of our stay in Macau and we were really excited to try their signature Beijing roast duck, we had a slightly odd variety of starters but they were still pleasant just not quite suited to our European palate, the dim sum we had next were tasty but a very small portion with only 4 dim sum for around 140 hkd. We had ordered half a duck next for a cost of 480 HKD, a whole duck was brought to the table and a very small portion was carved for us and placed on the table, at most a quarter of duck, and the rest taken away. It was tasty but no where near good enough to justify the cost and a tiny portion. We left feeling hungry and quite disappointed."
4,Tanya B,None,None,19-March-2019,"This restaurant has a gorgeous interior and the food is exquisite. It is a bit expensive, but the food is worth it if you want to treat yourself to a nice meal."
5,T4622ZHsteve,Lytham St Anne's,United Kingdom,26-December-2018,"Whenever i visit Macau this is the one restaurant i look forward to visiting the most, the food is always of an excellent standard. The staff are always attentive and will help with recommendations. Although not as reasonable in price as it has been in the past, the portion sizes are large so it is still great value for money. My favorite dishes are the Egg Plant with Garlic and Soy and the Stir Fried Lamb with Cumin."
6,LinaJ470,Jakarta,Indonesia,19-December-2018,"My 2nd dinner at Beijing Kitchen during my travels in Macao

17,tassosk5,None,None,24-February-2018,"Perhaps the best restaurant in the Grand Hyatt, it features a wood-fire overn (apparently the wood comes for Beijing) for achieving the authentic flavour of the Beijing duck. There are also Cantonese and Shanghainese dishes, but it's best if you focus on Beijing imperial cuisine. Impecable service enhances the experience"
18,TimL3857,Phnom Penh,Cambodia,1-January-2018,"Quality and service were great but price is very high since it’s in a casino hotel . Peking duck has to be ordered one day in advance. It can be ordered in a half though."
19,DocThurm,Burlington,Iowa,16-October-2017,"We experienced nearly everything on the menu. It was a large group that was able to sample so many items on the menu. The service was great. The Peking Duck was tremendous. I had never had it but will have it again. We enjoyed the experience and look forward to returning."
20,VBeary,Bangkok,Thailand,15-October-2017,"We went to try this restaurant because of the reviews on TripAdvisor but the taste of the foods and services were both average. The pecking duck was not something to rave about it was so average and pricey. If you have tried the pecking duck roasted apple wood in Hong Kong then don't waste your time with this ones.
The pancake to wrap the duck with was so dry and stick to each other quite badly. At this price you would expect that each pancake sheet would be separated by a sheet of paper. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is nice but I wouldn't go back or recommended this place due mainly to the average taste and quality that doesn't match the price."
21,RoyW916,Armidale,Australia,25-September-2017,"Three of us dined at this restaurant and usually you have to arrange for the duck specialty in advance. Lucky for us someone had cancelled so we were able to enjoy this truly magnificent dish. If you are in Macau then this is a must do.
The restaurant is comfortable and the staff are extremely helpful. The wine selection is good and not over priced.
Would I eat here again - absolutely!"
22,christianf400,Rothenbuch,Germany,12-September-2017,"Truly the best Beijing Duck ever!
Prepared at the table, perfect taste and texture, absolutely delicious!
Big and open places, but also cosy nice niches to enjoy excellent chinese food.
All different plates were so tasty, but I cannot recall any names except the duck.
Try anything, but be careful not to order intestines..."
23,Christophe B,Montreal,Canada,8-June-2017,"We had both a casual dinner with colleagues and a business lunch with customers and the Beijing Kitchen was excellent in both instances, with well-paced and discreet services and succulent Northern Chinese cuisine.

The Peking Duck is their signature dish, but do bear in mind that you'll have to order additional dishes as it will feed no more than a party of 2 -and you'll want additional rice and veg, as a minimum.

The 7 course menu was succulent and well balanced"
24,missytanval,Tokyo,Japan,5-April-2017,"Located at the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Macau, the Beijing Kitchen specializes in Northern Chinese cuisine. Like the rest of the hotel, the restaurant is classy and a good place for hosting business clients and social gatherings alike. It is famous for its wood-fired Peking duck, one of the best we have tasted to date.

My husband and I re-visited the restaurant for dinner recently. We received a warm welcome from Asst Manager Vivian who recognized us immediately even though it has been a while since we last went. As we had not made prior reservation and did not want to wait an hour for its famed Peking duck this time, we chose to have spicy noodles, pan-fried dumplings and one of the restaurant's other signature dishes, crispy fried fish with sweet and sour sauce. Our host Vivian was extremely helpful with food recommendations, and she helped us to have the chefs tailor the dishes according to our preference.

Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Besides Vivian, we also received warm and attentive service from AM Jennifer and Richard. Our hosts surprised us with a beautifully presented dessert assortment at the end of our meal. Wow!

Our thanks again to Jennifer, Vivian, Richard and your team for a truly delightful dining experience. We will definitely be back!"
25,fishlover22,Toronto,Canada,14-March-2017,"We came here for the peking duck. Sad to say it didn't meet my expectations. At 698/duck there was not much meat served considering it was one whole duck sliced beside your table. It barely fed our party of 4. I had only 2 wraps. We had to order some noodles to feed our hungry stomachs."

Peking duck was amazing. Skin so crispy. The meat was succulent and had the right amount of fat. The duck bones were then fried as a separate dish which was also good.

All the other food was delicious. Service is good. Well worth the visit. Would recommend it to anyone and would definitely come back. Prices are on the high side but to be expected at the Grand Hyatt"

Nevertheless- we chose some other food which was nicely presented and tasty, but the service is rather cold and food mall like, no smiles except the supervisor, the staff would be emotionless and not very friendly, which is unusual for a Hyatt hotel."

66,Inness L,Taupo,New Zealand,28-January-2015,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Macau, especially for Chinese cuisine. I usually go with some friends. The restaurant is serving great and authentic northern Chinese dishes, such as Peking duck, dumplings, noodles, pan fry lamb etc. Their Peking duck is really delicious, the skin is nicely cut and presented, with the classic pair with the  yellow chives , the sauce and the thin bread. Amazing to pair the Peking duck with a nice glass of pinot noir. Highly recommended this restaurant, Peking duck is a must try."
67,johnpond,Sydney,Australia,9-January-2015,"One of the best if not the best Asian restaurants ever. Situated in the Grand Hyatt Macau, this outstanding restaurant offers superb Asian cuisine.

A good place for dining for the show goers."
71,MIchiu4,None,None,21-November-2014,"This is my favorite high end chinese restaurant in Macau. The setting is very appropriate, not too traditional. It's spacious and tables are far from each other. It gives you a sense something is happening, with people walking past.
I have been there a few times and the food is always good, the Peking Duck is excellent, all the more spicy or sour dishes i have had are very good, you can sense the quality and professionalism. It's not a warm and cosy place but it's not noisy either. The service is, of course, good, not too intrusive. Although I prefer to have this kind of chinese food with a group it's perfectly ok for a couple."
72,LondonLifestyle2010,London,United Kingdom,14-November-2014,"We were meeting up with family friends on a Sunday night and being a local she recommended Beijing Kitchen.

My husband & I already had Peking duck the night before when we were visiting Hong Kong and decided to give it another go. To our surprise the duck was almost as good as the one we had in Hong Kong. The rest of the dishes were mouth watering especially the dumpling dishes (fried & steamed). I wasn't too keen on the pork and noodle soup as the pork was quite tough but the soup and noodles were delicious.

The services was excellent and the waitress/waiter were not constantly in our face but attentive. It was also quite busy for a Sunday evening (we reserved the table for 8:30pm).

I would go back on our next trip to Macau."

All was very good, spiced to perfection with an efficient and friendly service. Will come back to taste the duck."
75,TravelPalS_12,Zurich,Switzerland,6-October-2014,"I love pretty much all about this place. The spicy chicken was perfectly fiery. The dumplings delicious, the rice noodles tasty and the beef in it very nice. They have a wood fire for their Beijing Duck, which I have yet to try... I am sure it will be equally great an experience.

Deco is modern and tasteful. You can watch the people working in the kitchen. Service is attentive and the place is child friendly. Eg providing high chair etc. at the same time, the restaurant is large enough, for those which don't want to sit near a family... The place features a number of very nicely sheltered tables where you might forget that there are there are other people in the restaurant. Private rooms are available too."

The bill came to around £53, so not bad for 4 alcoholic drinks, 4 starters, main and rice.
I'd definetly recommend eating here if you can."
82,Malihousa,Ann Arbor,Michigan,29-April-2014,"The soup of rice crust and three delicacies was delicious. The rice crust was crispy and not over cooked. The Sliced noodles was good but you have to wait for awhile. They sliced the Beijing Duck right beside the table for you was interesting to watch.

The attitude of the asst manager was 'take it or leave it', which is not Grand Hyatt standard. Not a place I would rush back to when there are so many good restaurants just down the street at Taipa Plaza."

Restaurant was full when we arrived, but sure enough there was our table. Waiting staff pleasant and explained everything and then soon after out can the duck. It was carved at our table and suggestions made about how to eat it. Greta experience and food was lovely.

Only down side was the air conditioning in the restaurant was a bit on the cool side - but cant please everyone I guess."

We were not disappointed, the duck was excellent and the best I've had! The duck skin was very crispy, and the duck meat tender and juicy.

The staffs were very attentive, and came by several times to ask whether if we were enjoying our food. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of our dinner by a set of complimentary moon cakes as deserts, for the mid-autumn festival.

Overall a very nice experience, Peking duck is a must eat dish! Remember to make reservations first because it gets booked up easily on special days. We would definitely come back to this restaurant if we come to Macau again!"
91,kimng854,Singapore,Singapore,12-September-2013,"We had a table for 10 people and we ordered a peking duck. It was not presented and carved by the table like most restaurants, by the time the duck came to us, it was already on a platter with pieces, we didn't even see the whole duck.
The noodles were not nicely done and it was congealed. The other items - cold dishes, or siao zhi was just fair.
Quite disappointing as the ambience was nice and the setting was very impressive especially at the entrance with all the little teapots."
92,TristanAmelia,None,None,13-August-2013,"I had booked tickets for the House of Dancing Water in the adjoining casino, so decided to make reservations here. You need to book in advance to get the Peking Duck, which was divine. I want it right now. There's also an extensive list of teas on the menu, which I appreciate.."
93,Linaioo7,None,None,14-July-2013,"our experience having a half pecking duck was fun and delicious. Staff are friendly and kind enough to show us how to eat this meal."
94,Presser-canard,London,United Kingdom,29-June-2013,"The whole duck was ok but for me it doesn't do it any more...
The staff was very cold, distant and careless or the room was maybe...or perhaps me self..!
Honest, it was very good because i did not pay!
Diplomatic, i will definately come back...when i don't know.
Sarcastic, the pancakes were as cold as the staff and steaming like my brain...and hopefully not as clean as the ice cream fridge (not to mention).
Good luck if you go there...i mean if you go for the roulette game...

Design ok, toilet clean, no follow up from managment if we were ok..."

96,NineDragons,Ichikawa,Japan,14-June-2013,"I went there for lunch during company meeting.
Peking duck was authentic as other northern Chinese cuisine.
Waiters were too few for large table of approx 20 people. We had to wait for service because of that.
Quite many of fresh plates had to be returned for clean ones."
97,thehungrylady,manila,None,4-June-2013,"I've been to Macau twice or thrice these past two years and each time I'm there, Beijing Kitchen is always a must!

98,Boss527,None,None,28-May-2013,"Peking duck is a must try. Also try their Chinese hamburger (肉夹馍). Try their cold dishes of drunken chicken and jellyfish head. Peking duck is very surprising that it is much better than those in Beiing."

We had what can only be described as a wild mixture of dishes from the menu and every single one of them was simply very, very good. Amazing in quality and taste, complimented by very good service. No surprise that it's not the cheapest place around, but it sure is nice and worth the money."
102,thelittlebigsister,None,None,9-April-2013,"Famous for their Peking duck. Better order ahead as it takes one hour to cook this delicious dish. We were seated near the glass walled kitchen - very entertaining and educational to watch the master chefs at work. I would definitely go back again!"

113,kingcolt2016,None,None,29-October-2012,"The roasted duck was not as good as always. It was not well-marinated and the meat became quite tasteless. I think it's due to too many customers."
114,Terlo,HK,None,9-August-2012,"Did not do the duck, but over-heard the receptionist asking everyone telephoning in to book a table whether they would like one.

We went for more everyday dishes: various sorts of dumplings and pancakes, noodles, and vegetables.

Could not quite say the dishes we ordered were very good, perhaps because they tended to be a tiny bit character-less, or perhaps they were over-shadowed by the nice, spicy sauces provided on the table.

Or perhaps the chefs in the small show kitchens succeeded in uprooting these everyday dishes from their humble street origins and down-to-earth flavours, but are still in search of ways to refine them for the upmarket Beijing Kitchen dining tables.

So this is not exactly one of those restaurants that we would make an effort to return to, especially with the wide range of other choices available in the City of Dreams complex, where the restaurant is located.

One entrance of the restaurant is at the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and the other next to the entrance of the theatre of The House of Dancing Water show.

The restaurant has a better ambience in the evening. When it is dark outside, you tend not to notice the car-park at the side of the restaurant and the cars parked directly facing the tables located along the restaurant's floor-to-ceiling glass window."
115,theovanightsensation,Hyogo,Japan,11-January-2012,"I went with 2 others and we ordered a whole Peking duck. The duck was fantastic, crispy skin. But, they served some breast meat with the pancakes. We ordered deep fried duck bones for our second course. This was delicious, but i think the soup might've been a better option.

The service was fantastic as you'd expect. They let us sample a little bit of each wine before deciding on a bottle.

highly recommended if you want to eat Peking duck in Macau"
116,EarthDiscover,Canada,None,27-June-2011,"We have an early arrival for dinner. It has 2 open kitchens, clean and organized. We order a Peking duck. Oh it is so good that you can’t have it in North America. The chef is skillful in peeling the duck into different dishes: sizzling crispy skin and the duck meat. There is not much fat in the duck. Each piece is almost the same size. The other order is shredded pork on rice but this new attempt is a failure. The service is excellent. The environment is very nicely decorated with a very high ceiling. Definitely can give it a try"

The tofu claypot was rightly salted, not too oily or too bland.

The Kai Lan stir fry w ginger was great. We could taste the sweetness of the vegetable while the ginger was not too spicy.

The preserved vegetable with pork rib was just right with the meat falling off the bone.

Finally the pea shoot fish broth looked good and tasted good. The broth was good enough to drink on its own!

Desserts wise the almond tea and the crispy pancake was delicious too :)

If I had known Canton was this good... I would have probably avoided Imperial* for sure

Would definitely come back again when in Macau."

But now everything is back to standard. Old favorites like the fish head in pot and the crispy fried chicken are must-trys.

Service was and still is great. Servers are warm and friendly and they recognize us as old time clients whenever we visit."

In the past,the food quality and the service have always exceed our expectations. But in our recent visit, On a late Monday evening (21/05/2018), the dishes served was a disgrace. Out of the five dishes ordered, four of them was barely warm enough and the dishes were served in long delayed intervals. The food wasn't fresh.There was no bite to it, both the fish dishes we ordered was so bad that it couldn't be picked up by using chopsticks, the sweet and sour pork with tropical fruit was substituted with limp root vegetables, the pork lotus dish was also barely warm enough ,bland and greasy, just a really stodgy last order of the evening assembled hurriedly by the chefs whilst cleaning the kitchen I guess. The service was slow, borderline non existent The waiting staffs were just too busy prioritising setting up tables for the next shift. After this experience, I will definitely give Canton a miss on our future visit to Macau."

There is a set menu for HK 420 per person , you can pick and choose 5 items from a set listing , a good deal . We preferred to order from the main menu Iberico pork barbarcue ( outstanding ) , Peking duck ( done to perfection ), abalone with goose web ( yum),steam spotted grouper ( best ),healthy stirred fried green beans , the desert complementary ! The best meal in Macau for me"

We had perhaps the BEST Siu Mai (燒賣 / 烧卖) we have ever tried in Macau AND Hong Kong!

It was part of a fantastically value-for-money 5-course lunch set (~HKD200 per person w service/tax). The other items we chose from the set were great too.

It is located just off the casino floor next to North and Morton's Steak House. Tastes even better on a comp! Casual dress is ok in this upscale restaurant. Don't worry about smoke either.

Atmosphere: beautiful music and ambience. The decorations was classy

Service: professional and prompt. Excellent service.

Food: horrible is an understatement. I drank excessive water to clear my mouth. They cant even cook noodles right. Honestly, how is that possible?! You are a chinese restaurant. The chicken and abalone soup tasted like salted water - even worse than canned soup. The barbeque pork was just okay. The scallops was tasteless. The beef was soaked in a gooey sauce that is so sweet it would make a diabetic cry. The food court at venetian is crappy but it is 10x better than at canton. Please do everyone a favor and close shop. Even if you paid me I wouldnt go back to suffer this crappy meal."

Around the corner from the Sheraton Hotel in the mall is Crystal Jade which specializes in Noodles and Dumplings. The noodles were amazing and fresh, always good. We had various Xiao Long Bao dumplings and thought they were good, but not as good as Din Tai Fung. We had soup and fried rice also and both were excellent. The atmosphere is nice/clean in a typical mall restaurant mode. We went in at between lunch and dinner times and our experience with the service was very good. Please keep in mind that most of the staff speaks only little English. However, they do have a few servers that speak better English and have menus that contain English.

323,SKT88,Vancouver,Canada,16-November-2019,"Do not understand how others can give this restaurant a 5?
They must have a different appreciation of food than me.
Restaurant is inside the Parisian Casino so it's very noisy, kind of like a McDonald's of Xiao Long Bao. Service was mediocre at best and food looked and taste terrible.
For a plate of plain vegetable of Gai Lan, we asked for minimum oil and it came dripping with oil. The dumplings had a very thick skin making it undesirable to eat.
The noodles were starchy and the only item that tastes decent was the drunken chicken. Stay away from this overrated restaurant.
Noticed that most customers were just running in and out from the casino to grab a bite between bets."
324,macaulivin,None,None,13-November-2019,"The food was supposed to be so wonderful and amazing. It was really just kind of so so and blah. Highly overpriced for a bowl of noodles and a tiny amount of mian jin.
Service also disappointment as they cleared my table when I went to the restroom, then when I returned, they brought back the plates from the bus station or somewhere. Also, it was a struggle to communicate in English and Mandarin, so maybe they intend only locals or Cantonese speakers to visit.

Probably will not return."

The really great thing about this restaurant though, is that it’s open till 3 am (and all night on weekends, apparently). There are almost no other late-night dining options in the entire Sheraton/Parisian/Venetian complex (at least none that we could find), so at 1 am it was a delight that something was still open, makes the food all the more delicious ;)"

459,LABWong,Taoyuan District,Taoyuan,9-April-2019,"Delicious food, price sort of expensive. 4 dishes $400 local currency. Seating casual. A very negative feedback: while we were eating,the waiter brought us the bill to pay. We said we would order more. After a while, another waitress brought us the bill again while we had not finished our food and we didn't ask for it. She did the same to every table. My mom was quite upset at this annoying gesture. No clue why they had such weird practice. The restaurant had only 10% table occupancy and there was absolutely no need to rush customers to pay at all. Another weird thing is they do not accept RMB Chinese currency. I am from Hong Kong and it doesn't affect me, but over 50% tourists are from Mainland China who use RMB $. Not a smart policy to attract customers."

We were not dissapointed.

The restaurant is located in the middle of the Gambling Floor, make sure to look for it there as we couldn’t find it at first in the restaurant section!

The food? Amazing! The prices were also super reasonable for such a swanky and stylish place! The waiters were quite amazing and our experience was overall great!

Would recommend!"

472,Moonlight,Los Angeles,California,11-March-2019,"Allegedly ranked #1 out of over one thousand restaurants in Macao on Trip Advisor was the reason I visited this place. The place was nearly empty during dinner hour should have been a warning.

The hot and sour soup has a layer of red chili oil on top, and completely salty and disgusting. The 雪菜 bean curd dish was sour in a retched kind of way. Both dishes had to be returned. Both the chef and the manager on duty were unapologetic saying that those dishes were supposed to taste that way - according to who? I wondered.

The xiao long bao were mediocre (Ding Tai Fung and other placed are much better).

How could this restaurant be so highly recommended on Tripadvisor, I asked myself?

I then noticed that majority of the five star reviews are all by reviewers with ONLY ONE REVIEW. IMO, those prior rave reviews about restaurant are either FAKE or those reviewers have never been to a decent restaurant. Spare yourself the torment, and skip this place at all costs."

Red angry looking Baos are hot because it is infused with chili liquid. But wait for La Mian with Poached Beef in Szechuan soup. It is spiciest dish I ever had.

499,andreaguiarf,Geneva,Switzerland,25-January-2019,"The food here was good. While visually their xiao long bao isn't as delicate as Din Tai Fung's, tastewise I would say it as good as or perhaps even more delicious. The pork meat was very juicy and well-seasoned, and the broth was abundant and tasty. Also, their lamian was a very positive surprise and it seems to be freshly made in-house. The portions were quite big. Prices are reasonable. Expect to pay MOP 450 (USD 55) for a variety of main and side dishes for two. Another good thing about this place is that it is open until quite late (3:00 AM, if I'm not mistaken). Most restaurants in Macau seem to close around 10:00 PM, which is quite strange actually for a city that calls itself the  Las Vegas of Asia ."

The Xiao Long Bao, DTF's signature dish, was extremely tasty and the Niu Rou Mian (Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup) was brill, too! They do boast both in front and in the restaurant about their inclusion in the Michelin Guide for their HK & Macau restaurants and they do deserve that!

763,SH C,Seoul,South Korea,30-August-2018,"I do go to Din Tai Fung for dishes, especially dumplings and signature Taiwanese noodle dishes, but the the services in both SOHO and Studio City are poor. No evidence of the effort to maximize convenience of the diners can be seen, from table seating to food ordering. No smile or caring gestures can be found. Macau's Din Tai Fung is overpriced and at least one dish and one drink should be ordered per person. Keep in mind, in addition to a 68~100 MOP noodle and a 68-MOP xiaolongbao, you need to order 30~40 MOP drinks when you are budgeting for the visit here. I would prefer Din Tai Fung in HK (it's bigger and lively, and even if it's crowded, the foods taste better and the tables seem to be laid out better (I've never felt in HK Din Tai Fung that I was being bothered by the neighboring diners, but I do in SOHO.)"

This Macau our inside the City of Dreams is nice , clean , busy , efficient . 6 of us went for lunch ( we arrived 1130 am , by noon the place is packed . The Variety of Xiaolong Bao up to standard ( tasty , plump , only one skin was broken out of 24 not bad ) spicy cumcumber , drunken chicken , chicken soup , pan fried dumplings ( pork and veggie ) all very good .

While Din Tai Fung has a number of outlets around the world, the original was in Taiwan and you can now find Din Tai Fung in countries such as Australia, Thailand, Japan and Macau. Each time I am so excited to eat the dumplings, not much different from the outside, but still all so tasty. The beef noodle are ok, the soup base is strong, beef is tender and noodles are smooth, not the best but ok. The Xiao Long Bao are the best, with thin skins and flavorful soup inside. Xiao Long Bao could be said as one of the best Chinese food in the world mate. There is a reason this place has the reputation of being one of the best dim sum places around - the food is always excellent, the service is super-efficient and the price is reasonable. Compared to the other popular soup dumpling places, I'd rank Din Tai Fung first. As a conclusion, this restaurant is actually really nice. Would recommend to everyone to try at least once."

Dim sum not special.

Total package not to my liking especially when the bill arrived.
Sorry but that was last try."
793,Captain_Halliday,Brisbane,Australia,11-May-2015,"For those who aren't aware, this is a chain restaurant. As noodle and dumpling places go it's average at best.

The food was fair for this style, though a bit oily. Service was okay, but it's very expensive.

On our visit we just wanted a quick bite after a show so we could get our young child home to bed. Unfortunately quick wasn't possible. We were also forced to order drinks, despite not wanting or needing any. In hindsight we should have walked out at this point.

They apparently have a HKD10 minimum order on drinks which was not on a sign or printed on the menu. We then asked for the minimum serving of tea, which was HKD10 on the menu. Yet when the bill came we were charged HKD20.

795,KateSiena,Jakarta,Indonesia,18-March-2015,"Din Tai Fung is one of my favorite restaurant. My bf and I eat there at least twice a month in Jakarta. But this one in Macau is just wayyyyyy better.
The restaurant is more clean, spacious, and professional. It also has better service, (fast serving, polite, warm, and the never let our glasses empty) - more menu choices, including varieties of very very tasty dim sum. I especially like the dumpling with soup. The broth was sooo good. It's super!"

799,H0bbits_travels,Melbourne,Australia,29-September-2014,"We really did enjoy this place but it was lacking the usual Din Tai Fung feel. The food was nice but not great. The service was also just off the mark as well. We hoped for 5 stars but got 4. In saying all of this I am grading it against all the oth err Din Tai Fungs in Asia that we have been to, this place is still very good and worth the look."
800,excusemewaiter,Sydney,Australia,23-January-2020,"For 168MOP pp (before service charges), we indulged in delectable dim sums and 3 courses. Starting with a free amuse bouche and soup, main (garoupa vs ostrich) and others, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambiance."

We stayed at the Conrad and Conrad Guest Services assisted us with making our reservation. The staff were all friendly and welcoming. Some were entertaining too. Prior to arriving, we had a general idea of what we wanted to order-from pictures and reviews, however, staff were very helpful with recommending signature dishes and dishes that met everyone’s dietary needs. Overall, our visit to Dynasty 8 was awesome and we will definitely be returning!"

Located at the Sands Conrad hotel, the restaurant has an elegant decor suitable for holding both business or private functions. Besides dim sum (available for lunch only), it offers an extensive ala carte menu for lunch and dinner. On our recent visit, we also tried its weekday set lunch which offered a sampling of its best sellers, very good value for money indeed. The restaurant also offers complimentary appetizers and desserts, another plus. Service is consistently good and its staff are attentive and helpful, especially Vintty and Lisa. We wish to thank Lisa for her food recommendations as we thoroughly enjoyed our recent meal."

We thought this was just going to be another Chinese meal but as soon as the dishes started coming, a totally awesome dining experience began to unfold. The fusion of great Chinese cooking from different regions all bursting with flavors was really so amazing. There will be no guessing when you visit this place for a great meal. Dynasty 8 will simply be beyond your expectations. Definitely a “must go to” place when we visit Macau again."
825,andreabM9766ZO,None,None,8-February-2019,"We had a dinner for 2 and had a three course meal. Had lotus roots with sticky rice. It was a surprise because every other time I had this dish it is was an almost sweet dish. This version was pickled root so not sweet. Second we had barbecue ribs. The ribs were nice looking but the meat was chewy / tough. Third we had duck. After enjoying pecking duck in other places this version was just meh.
The best part of the dinner was the desert we got on the house with a smoking plate, red bean sticky rice and some fruit. Great presentation."

830,Crystalism,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,18-August-2018,"We visited because of some cash voucher offered by the casino which came up to about HKD888? Had some dimsum, roast meat and noodles which came up to around HKD1.5k before deducting? I thought the pricing is reasonable for hotel food.

The food is nothing to shout about - nothing spectacular but definitely nothing bad. We enjoyed our lunch over here with some hits and misses but generally it’s very normal dimsum. It’s definitely a safe choice and we will return if we ever stay in Sheraton again as the food here is above average.

Service was alright too, rather slow but bearable as it was a Sunday anyway."
831,wstokes1965,Sydney,Australia,2-July-2018,"It is in one of the mega malls (between the Conrad and the Sheraton) but surprisingly very calm, local and upscale once inside. You must try the dumplings, the vegetarian rice and of course the Beijing Duck pancakes. The food was plentiful and every dish delicious. The service was attentive, efficient and many of the staff spoke Sone English - I would recommend."
832,charcyx,London,United Kingdom,10-June-2018,"Ordered a couple dim sums to share between the five of us and the crab craw each
Pretty impressive with the innovative dim sums
Find the banana and prawn roll with rose cream quite refreshing
And the crab craw!! Both the steamed one and the deep fried one are beautifully executed!
Recommended!"

Signature pan fried mushrooms buns and lobster soup dumpling outstanding Desert the durian tart is special. We stuffed ourself in 1 1/2 hr , need good tea to keep us awake for the meeting !!"
834,Bookedtravel,Ottawa,Canada,19-March-2018,"The Lunch Menu is like a Chinese tapa, there is a little bit of everything but enough food to get you full. They are all very delicious. The dessert is to die for, either hot or cold. We have been there twice. The regular menu is pricey, the set lunch is the way to go, you can taste good food at a reasonable price. Service is very good. Highly recommended!"
835,853HungryCat,Macau,None,14-February-2018,"Went with friends for pre-Chinese New Year gathering, because a friend had said good on this hotel. Found out on spot they had a special menu for Chinese New Year (CNY), respectively at their Chinese restaurant  Dynasty 8  and their lobby lounge.

Reunion meals are crucial to Chinese during CNY period, so one can imagine there are all kinds of delicacies on the table: abalone, suckling pig, garoupa, shiitake mushrooms, etc.

Specially liked the soup dish, which was a double-boiled broth with Chinese floral herbs, dried scallops, and shiitake mushrooms. Even though having been double-boiled, the broth was clear to the bottom when served. It was quite a palate cleanser.

After lunch we moved on to the lobby lounge where they were serving CNY-themed afternoon tea set, which was a blend of Eastern and Western snacks, such as Chinese buns and English scones. Many of the snacks were made cute and fairy. Some of them were made pink because, as far as I know, Conrad Macao has been a big supporter of breast cancer initiatives, which take pink as a campaign colour."
836,Adcairns,Brisbane,Australia,11-February-2018,"And that’s a big call!
Seriously goog food at a reasonable price. I’m not going to say it was cheap, but certainly not expensive either.
We had BBQ duck (great), grouper with orca( Devine) and the best fried rice I have ever eaten!
Many thanks to Cassandra who recommended the dishes as she was spot on.

Talking about food taste and value, I would say it is quite on a regular hotel standard. Suggest to check out its special offer menu. You may find a good deal."
841,yuhongronniek,None,None,2-September-2017,"Very good service Extremely expensive and quality only acceptable A crab meat spring roll. Not crispy and not good presentation.

845,minhtranSG,None,None,19-January-2017,"Four of us went to Dynasty 8 for dinner and like the black pepper beef the best. I also liked the overall experience but the food was average considering the high prices. I think there are better restaurants for the money at Sheraton Grand Hotel."
846,Pivotalguy,Gold Coast,Australia,13-January-2017,"Dined at Dynasty8* on the recommendation of the hotel concierge. Was met at the door by a well presented and knowledgeable lady who placed us at a nice table.

Good to see tables not jammed in. Tables and chairs were well set and the whole ambience of the restaurant was first class.

We had a live fish steamed in soy sauce and some delicious crab and other dishes. The food was awesome and well above expectations. Staff professional and attentive and the the food arrived in a timely fashion

Overall a great place to eat and a place we will visit again when next in Macau.

First Class Cantonese Seafood."
847,AEF_No,Stavanger,Norway,4-January-2017,"I had a really nice evening with my sister trying out a lot of different authentic dishes. One was better then the next. We went reasonably late (9.30 pm) and we were the only guests left pretty soon after we arrived- so it was very surprising when the service was unattainable on numerous occasions- which is not something you take lightly considering the price you pay for your dinner,
Don't get me wrong: the food was great but the service could have definitely been better."
848,TobyZurich,Zurich,None,5-December-2016,"Very pleasant large typical Chinese restaurant with the highlights of all Chinese regions. Excellent quality and very warm and professional service in English. Chinese is best in a larger group of at least four people, but the excellent staff helped us select interesting and perfectly balanced dishes even for just us two."
849,RogerYUL,Montreal,Canada,19-November-2016,"I always come here for family diner. It has a good selection of food and it is easy to find.

However, before that happened I can say that pork was great, so was duck and seafood. The flavored Chinese liquor in small shot glasses helped digest everything."
853,foodiehk2014,Sydney,Australia,4-May-2016,"Food was fantastic and their menu extensive. We stayed at Conrad so it was easy after sightseeing and shopping and thought something simple and without too high expectations, to my surprise, it is so much better than HK and way better than the Chinese Golden leaf at the Conrad HK"

All food was good and delicious except soup.
Service very good"
855,CooperandCo331,Adelaide,Australia,30-December-2015,"The food was delicious to look at and taste and there was a good level of service. What stunned us was the TINY amount of wine when we ordered by the glass. We just looked at each other with puzzled faces. For the price of the wine it spoiled the evening and we are still talking about it to others."
856,AAPereira,Luanda,Angola,28-December-2015,"Very nice Restaurant, and friendly service.
The food is perfect, for me one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Taipa or even Macau."
857,trixieleemeiling,None,None,17-December-2015,"Your regular dim sum is a level above here. expect porridge with abalone, egg tart with birds nest, glutinous rice with scallop, almond cream with mango, carrot cake with XO sauce."
858,sanchdog,Gold Coast Australia,None,15-December-2015,"I went to a private function here, so I didn't get to choose the menu, but had a feast of 8 or 9 courses.

859,jacklagare,Luzon,Philippines,30-November-2015,"Admittedly, it's a bit expensive. I believe though that I got my money's worth. The food was superb and the waitresses were very helpful and attentive. There's a bit of a language barrier but for me, that's minor."
860,Bernardo S,None,None,18-October-2015,"Food was mediocre and the service was really bad. Way below standard for what it is worth. The general staff does not seem to understand what they were suppose to be doing and the sequence of serving food was non-existent"
861,Mary-Anne M,Perth,Australia,12-September-2015,"We celebrated our anniversary at Dynasty 8 for dinner, and were very happy with the food and service. We had booked earlier in the day, and our lovely waitress remembered us and was very attentive. She spoke good English which was helpful. The decor was very nice, even had a tablecloth and two sets of chopsticks for shared and your own usage. Also had a little stool for my handbag to sit on. All of these little touches made it a special meal. Recommend the suckling pig."
862,Didier H,None,None,22-August-2015,"Most restaurants around are quite expensive anyway. This one is one of the most expensive but it's probably one of the best."

The server was impressive as she knew how to 'sell' and explain each on the menu, she would also give strong recommendations based on your choice in her perfect English. Ambience, quality of food, reasonable price were highlights. We had Beef in pepper sauce, chicken broth soup, multi-colored rice, broccoli with scallops and eggplant sautéed, All tasted well. Service was fast."
864,CalvinW584,None,None,26-June-2015,"Some of the best and most unique dim sum dishes I've ever had! A bit pricey but I guess everything non hole in the wall is pricey in Macau. Definitely go try it if you can afford it."
865,Debsuenz,None,None,3-June-2015,"The food was very tasty however for the price we paid and the portion sizes we received I didn't think it was great value for money...but hey what can you expect for a restaurant in a casino."
866,RichieLH-Malvern,Great Malvern,United Kingdom,27-May-2015,"Dynasty 8 is in the Sands Cotai complex and attached to the Conrad Hotel. We ate here to celebrate a birthday. A glass of Champagne started us off and they brought along nuts and nibbles while we browsed the menu. Our waitress spoke great English and we began to discuss the dishes; she recommended the stuffed crab claw (a restaurant signature dish) which we tried with another crab dish, some pork, a vegetable and a fried rice so 5 dishes between 2 with tea. They then served a fruit platter as a palette cleanser and that was enough for us, no need for a dessert. By the way, the stuffed claw was simply amazing and a must-try. Great flavour and a subtle sauce to finish it off. It was only 1 claw per serving but enough for us to try and delight in.

Service was impeccable, the surroundings were great and those little things just made the trip memorable (right down to the little stool to put bags and shopping). We spent a little over £100, this included the Champagne and for me, it was an excellent price for the quality of food, service and surroundings. By comparison, we spent a little less for an ordinary meal in Hong Kong without drinks."
867,VAGypsyGirl,None,None,23-May-2015,"I ate dinner here three nights during the past week because of the high quality and great service! Located in the mall attached to the Conrad, this restaurant is especially nice because it is quiet and peaceful, unlike many of the other restaurants nearby.

They have excellent Peking duck!"
868,KaisiKruus,Sydney,Australia,17-May-2015,"Just loved it!! So nice food and service was very good.
We had the crab, prawns with egg white and the stir fry Wagyu beef. The crab was so delicious and I finished off my meal with mango-sago dessert which was the best dessert I have ever had!"
869,KevinJJJ,Da'an,Taipei,3-May-2015,"We dined at Dynasty 8 before a concert. Service is great and food is served promptly. We had an appetizer, a soup, and a main course (not too much food as there was only the 2 of us). Food is nicely prepared and delicious, but also not cheap. We wished to have tried more of the dishes on the menu...

They have 8 private rooms (named after the 8 dynasties). Very classy Chinese restaurant I'd say, and good for large groups."

Professional service and very friendly staff - ask for everything, they will find it for you. Couldn't be happier with the foods that sophistication decorated and cooked with special care. very outstanding tasts especially the crispy pork and orcking duck. I dont usually have much for dinner, nut this meali sweared i had to unbotton my pant. For desert, i had friend sesame balled stuffed with custard cream- was said to be best seller here. Highly recommended!!!"
875,Missuzi,Perth,Australia,18-November-2014,"Food here was amazing. We were lucky enough to be there on the first night a new chef started. It was delicious from start to finish. Tried a lot of dishes I've never had that is typical in Western Cuisine and was pleasantly surprised at how much i loved them! Definitely recommend!"
876,Mike C,Singapore,Singapore,15-November-2014,"Excellent service throughout the night. Attentive and responsive. Very professional and kind. Food was alright. Fish was outstanding but the rest was just ok for me. Atmosphere in the private room was simply average as well. Strange having plasmas hanging on the wall. Perhaps it is used for presentations and events? Either way - no need for me to return to this restaurant."
877,TravelPalS_12,Zurich,Switzerland,19-October-2014,"We went in not realizing this is part of the Conrad. I guess that's good because we would have been even more disappointed. The deco is highly priced, but only ok. In essence it's one quite big room with about 25 tables. I guess having a private room would make the experience better.

We had a number of dishes, none of which made a lasting impression (I was there 10 days ago). What was truly disappointing was the Peking duck which they cut and wrapped for us. Do assure that you can do it yourself, in our case they put so much plum sauce, that we could barely taste anything else. Truly a shame and not worthy the level of a Conrad restaurant. We also asked for a vegetable which normally is served with shrimps. We asked to exclude the shrimps due to a food allergy. All good and well, just that they wanted to charge the same amount looked odd. Perhaps ask to the some free shrimps when you visit. A simple vegetable for 180 MAP is simply not acceptable. Unfortunately they also handled my complaint very badly. 'The chef said he put more vegetable'... Anyhow it was a very small portion.

Go to the Hyatt for wonderful Chinese food. Avoid Dynasty 8 it's not worth your time and money.

A positive point to finish off. The high chairs for babies are first class."
878,davide124,Melbourne,Australia,1-October-2014,"I was in Macau for a conference of my organisation. A group of 9 of us dined at Dynasty 8 on one of our free evenings. We had arranged a private room with pre arranged set menu. The portions were appropriate and very tasty. The staff service was exemplary.

This restaurant is worth a visit especially staying at the Conrad hote."
879,flitting_bird,Hong Kong,None,12-September-2014,"Had dinner here and I liked the fact that there was a lot of variety on the menu where they have a few specialty dishes each from a few different provinces in China, Szechuan, Beijing, Canton, Macau, Swatow... etc..etc...

Food was uniformly good, well presented and plated. Certainly well above average. I did not feel that the prices were expensive considering the quality of the food and I would certainly recommend this restaurant. Expect to spend between HKD 500-600 per person without wine and live seafood."
880,Carrie_yeung,None,None,1-September-2014,"Stayed at Conrad and had Chinese lunch as it's nearby. The food quality is very good but it's a bit pricey...ordered dim sum and fried rice.. Will come back again"
881,VAGypsyGirl,None,None,3-August-2014,"This restaurant is listed as being a restaurant of the Conrad Cotai. It is actually located downstairs in the mall.

Service here is fast, friendly, and efficient. Many of the waiters speak at least some English and will be helpful in making selections.

The food is delicious, but pricey because of its location."
882,Hungry_little_Fox,Melbourne,Australia,18-April-2014,"We went to Dynasty 8 after arriving quite late in the evening and were wanting something close by for dinner. We ordered a number of dishes, of note was the crispy pork, stir fried beef with gai lan, and stuffed fried crab shells which were also tasty, but very rich. Clams in lemon and wine, we're very strong in lemon and it tasted like the wine hadn't been cooked out enough. The fruit platter and warm milk tea was a lovely parting gift, service was good."
883,masaccio,Huntingdon,United Kingdom,6-March-2014,"I picked Dynasty 8 mainly because I wanted something close to my hotel whilst on business in Macau. The reviews seemed OK, so off I went.

My waitress was very helpful in helping me select something on the menu and giving me advice on portion sizes since I was on my own. Food came surprisingly quickly, which I guess is a bonus for some. The wok-fried beef fillet was very tender and delicious. There was quite a lot of it after all, but it all went. The king prawns in my Szechuan chilli dish were enormous and the dish also very good.

My dinner was followed by some fruit and some kind of hot fruit drink, which was nice enough. Appeared to be some kind of freebie since it wasn't on the bill.

The whole thing came to MOP 500 including the obligatory 10% service charge. Pricey, but then it's casino central."
884,KVP2315,Chicago,Illinois,29-December-2013,"The food was wonderful-the best Chinese food I have ever had. We went for lunch and I would like to try dinner. The service was fantastic. Fine linens and china and good atmosphere. Make a reservation, even if you see empty tables as the girl at the front desk told us they were fully booked-I think because we are westerners. We finally threatened the manager with a call to the Conrad and things turned around and everyone was pleasant- otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars."
885,HY_SG,None,None,25-December-2013,"Best restaurant in the entire Macau, in terms of the services. Food, generally, good too. Try the Peking duck and crispy tofu. The 'Kungfu' tea was good too."

887,GarricsBarcelona,None,None,23-May-2013,"Very nice atmosphere. We love Chinese food particularly Beijing Duck. Fried rice with cod fish was also very nice. Good Tea selection."
888,Unbekannt,Berlin,Germany,3-April-2013,"The Dynasty 8 is located in the huge shopping/dining complex of the SandsCotai, consisting at this time of the Conrad (biggest in the world), Sheraton and Holiday Inn.

The dining area is one big area, no separation, walls, levels, whatever: feels a bit like a university cafeteria.

Plenty of staff, mostly attentive and friendly, but extremely uncommunicative. They seemed to be all Mandarin native speakers, but that should not have been a problem since we had one in our party, as well.

Quality of dishes was mixed at best, all served lukewarm, not to say cold.

 Daily soup  was described by waitress as  fish , our two orders tasted really strange, no fish meat inside. May be Eel consomme?

Fish appetizer bland.
Chicken in lotus and roasted pigeon were both extremely salty, but tasty, no complaints here.
Spicy Sichuan eggplant was not spicy and consisted mostly of potatoes.
Shanghai pork ok.

Portion sizes were small as to be expected, you need to order enough dishes.
Fruit platter for dessert without charge was a nice touch.

Price level on Las Vegas/Macao Casino level, be prepared for that.

I think Conrad hotels consider themselves on a level where customers can expect a much superior experience for dinner in their signature restaurant."
889,i_go_my_way,None,None,23-January-2013,"During the stay in Conrad Macao, they said this is their signature restaurant and we tried for dinner. Service and food quality very good and price level is very reasonable. In menu quite much choices. If you like Chinese food, Dynasty is a good choice."

902,yenak123,Seoul,South Korea,4-June-2019,"I found this place on tripadvisor and came with my mom for a quick lunch in a nice restaurant but ended up ordering three dishes and dessert. Young Chen served us and he was the best! Made jokes, asked questions, was genuinely so nice, gave really good recommendations (the mango dessert was AMAZING, my mom wants to go back to macau just for that), and really, his service and personality made our lunch twice as good and fun! The garoupa served two ways was exactly what my mom and i wanted. Soft fish with not too much marinade, and then also cooked with vegetables. Highly suggest that dish. Overall not busy or loud during regular lunch time but in a very fancy setting. I believe it came out to be around $150 USD for dimsum, garoupa, birds nest, and mango dessert (and coffee), which is really not bad for the service and dining quality. Truly the best fish I've had in a while. If you go, ask what they recommend, they know best!
PS Young Chen then offered us the red bean pudding because my mom was considering it earlier but he recommended the mango dessert, and that red bean was also so good. Service A++++++"

Having had lunch now the unanimous agreement was that this was a great meal. Well priced,for food and drinks but if you do not speak fluent Chinese find an app or translator to order our meals.

But then.

A serious word of warning- when we got our bill (in Chinese) then worked through each item, we found that we were charged for: chopsticks, initial tea and nuts; a chair fee along with other assorted charges that increased our bill by nearly 30%!!!"

Sweet and Sour pork was excellent"
911,mgplume,Riverview,Florida,8-May-2018,"If you are in Macau this restaurant is really worth the trip. I travel a lot in China and in Hong Kong, and this restaurant is at the same time very traditional Cantonese food but with a bit of modern style.

917,KC L,Singapore,Singapore,30-June-2016,"I had dim sum at this restaurant and was shocked by the poor quality. The char siu sou (baked bbq puff) was one of the worst I've ever tasted. It seemed left overnight and then microwaved before serving, being so soft, unlike the usual ones that I usually encountered. The XO fried carrot cake seemed to have been fried more than once and was extremely oily. The har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (park dumplings) are only average. The only redemption was the prompt and attentive service by the staff and the decent tea which earned it two stars instead of one."

They seated us, and gave us a menu but thats where it stopped. My husband actually put his hand in the air with the menu trying to catch someones attention. He did eventually and it appeared to be the manager or maitre de of the restaurant. But that didn't help. We got all of the food we ordered willy nilly. The rice actually after we had eaten everything else!
Plus they had left something off what we had ordered. My husband questioned the man again, once we could attract his attention again and he said that it would be a wait of 10 minutes - we said not to bother and left. Food wasn't that great and service was shocking. Plenty more places around who want your customer more."

The Baked Barbecue buns were our favorite."

Took them 2 minutes to make me pay (10% service in advance, they knew what they were doing) and 30 minute to get my food. Even worse was the fact that the food tasted awful (100 yuan for a dish like that is unbeilivable). Avoid at all cost!"

A hidden gem worthy of a visit for sure!"

A highly disappointing experience and poor value for the money."
964,Celestar989,Singapore,Singapore,23-November-2016,"Had ordered a few dishes of their dim sum to try for dinner. The carrot cake served was one of the worst I ever tasted, it was dry and tasteless.

965,LNZ0808,LNZ,None,21-August-2016,"This restaurant is just besides the entrance of the casino from The Venetian. It's a very big and busy restaurant. They seemingly have their own loyalty scheme, as we were asked if we would be members. We weren't, so we had to wait about 5 minutes until we were seated. Whilst waiting we were given the order list already. On that paper all the dishes are listed in English and Mandarin, and you just start ordering. We were the only non-Asians In the restaurant. This head waiter who took our order, was very kind and spoke quite good English (unlike the remaining team). When taking the order he asked whether we would need knife & fork. We declined the offer, as we are perfectly fine with chop sticks. Admittedly the smile got bigger.
The food was served quickly, and was delicious.
Like every dim sum place, and then having a casino in immediate proximity, the average guest doesn't stay longer than half an hour. We lasted a bit less than an hour, not because we struggled with the chop sticks, but we enjoyed and ate slowly.
Certainly a place to go again."

So at midnight, we had all the dim sum we usually have for brunch or tea - chicken feet, dumplings , etc. The food is expectedly average and not too expensive . Just a place for the Chinese gamblers to refuel, certainly not fine dining or award winning"

970,JGDynamo,Canada,None,4-August-2015,"We had a late lunch here after checking out of our room at the Venetian Resort an Casino. Our friends said they wanted to do dim sum with us so we agreed and were not disappointed. I started with the dried fish and peanut congee, my wife had the beef congee and we both had the Hong Kong style coffee.

The six of us ordered dim sum, bbq pork buns, pork ribs with garlic, steamed Chen Chuan, deep fried prawn wontons, chicken feet and an order of braised eggplant with salted fish. All were very good, the chicken feet were not my favorite as I just don't understand why anyone would eat them but I tried them anyway and they were okay. Lots of work for not much meat.

The deep fried prawns were so good we ordered another one as well as the bbq pork buns as my wife could have just eaten those for her meal.

We were in before the lunch rush, the place was not very busy so the service was great, food came out quickly and hot and they were great about my wife spilling her coffee everywhere. Cleaned it up quickly and got her a new plate, napkin and another coffee in under a minute. We tipped extra for that and would recommend the Imperial House Dim Sum for one of your meals while you stay at the Venetian. Now I am in the mood for dim sum, I will have to see what's in my area :)"

Upon entering the restaurant you just felt that it was going to be a great experience because the decor was elegant and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The lady that catered us recommended many signature dishes, the special Peach Oolong tea & the Chilled Cherry Tomato on Japanese Plum Wine jelly as an appetizer. Every dish was beautiful, tasty and exquisite. It was a great lunch and we wanted to go back for dinner. Sadly they were all booked up that evening and we had to leave the next morning. This is definitely the best restaurant we've had for lunch in Macau and may probably also for dinner should we had the chance to eat there. Great atmosphere, service and staff. Well done! Also noticed that the staff all wore a piece of jade with their uniform (outfit), a nice touch with the restaurant name and with green jade dragon on the table."

Jade Dragon is located in City is Dreams across from Wynn Palace and MGM.
The meal.......Amazing
The service....Top notch
The decor.....not a Wow factor but very elegant
When you dine here, you get the sense of a story. There is a beginning and ending. The food is very detail oriented and it is coupled with impeccable service.
If you get the pleasure, please request the staff of Jameson and Sarah. Multi-lingual, professional, soft spoken and extremely accommodating. Ask them anything about the menu, the restaurant and history, they are more than happy to answer and and all inquiries. The front of house staff is just as elegant and professional.
Anyone dining at a 3 Michelin star restaurant is not going to look at pricing so I won’t get into that.

By far, MUST GO, if you make a trip to the Cotai island.
It’s a true dining experience and worth every penny you spend.
Highly recommended and dress code is not as strict as other fine dining restaurants.
I wore very dark jeans, a dress shirt tucked out and loafers. I was fine.
Please add gratuity to such fine service."

This restaurant located in the city of Dreams, Macau, is the gem. Their seasonal tea is a must-try. This season (summer 2018) is a combination of green tea, osmanthus, rose etc. A great combination that I can never get enough of.
Thanks to the superb and professional service from the waiters (shout out to Brian) and the others for such a phenomenal dining experience. Their thoughtful and meticulous service really deserve 3 stars.
The crispy suckling pig with caviar was my favourite dish. Crispy and savoury all in one bite filling your mouth with flavours.
The interior and the ambiance were magnificent.
I really enjoyed my meal here and would definitely want to come back for more, especially for their signature lychee wood-smoked dishes."

I have always thought that it well deserves 3 stars, and it is much better than some other 3-star restaurants both in terms of food quality and meticulous service. The decor and the ambiance are first class. Having a meal there is having a superb dining experience that can’t be replicated elsewhere. Make it a point to dine at the Jade Dragon the next time you visit Macau. You will certainly want to come back for more."

1014,Tychoo72,Singapore,Singapore,5-March-2018,"Again.... We had dinner and also lunch. Never disappointed in this restaurant. Good food, good service, good tea and good ambience.

Food, must try the roasted goose and char siew.

Service, very attentive servers, always around you.

Tea, many varieties to choose from, but this is not important. What is important is that they never soak the tea leafs in the pot like many other restaurants do. The tea is being pour out into a separate pot for serving.

The ambience is always good, not too many tables and with the nice deco, you will sure enjoy.

Only one down side, the price is very steeeeep.... Hahaha..... However you pay for what you get.

One of our favourite restaurants."

They do not usually allow kids, but we were lucky enough to be able to secure a private room where kids were allowed. The room was nicely decorated with private powder room and the long sofa was perfect for the kid to relax after the meal.
The service and the food were both great. In particular, i loved their barbeque pork which was exceptionally tender and juicy.
It wasn't cheap but I think it was still good value for money for what we got overall."

With low expectations due to some mixed experiences I have previously had in Macau, I was absolutely blown away by the creativity, the flavor, the subtlty of service, and by the value of this amazing restaurant. The BBQ Iberico Pluma (shoulder) is their signiture dish and is not to be missed. Try pretty much anything that the chef calls a speciatly. The Brittany Lobster Claypot with glass noodles was exceptional. The crispy suckling pig stuffed with shrimp was amazing. The Braised udon noodles with fishmaw and Chicken was like the ultimate chicken noodle soup. I loved the restaurant. It is one of the best meals I have had all year. It is one of the best Chinese Restaurants on the planet.

We would fly to Macau mainly to have food here is how good this place is!

From top raw materials sourced from around the globe to cooking techniques and attention to details such as amount of food that sufficient but not over filling while flavor and textures of the food were composed to delight the palate in the most unique, entertaining and super delicious.

Highly recommended are Litchee Wood BBQ Iberico, Beef Brisket pepper soup, Double boiled fish maw, matsutake, and sea conch, Tempura giant Oyster, Dimsum...every dishes of dim sum is very very good, basically just let they know what you prefer and the staffs will recommend great tasting food that will delight you as they did me and my friends.

Biggest thanks to Chef Tam who are very talented and consistent about the quality of his food, Noel our waitress who were most helpful and attentive in every details.

Similar to another Michelin-star Chinese restaurant in Macau, Jade Dragon required big groups to dine in a private room with minimum charge. The restaurant and the private dining room were spacious enough for my old mother, who was in wheelchair, to move around, and the staff were very helpful. The dining room was tastefully designed. The staff were very attentive and whenever we needed their assistance, they were always around without making you feel being spied on or that they were invading your privacy. They introduced their signature dim sums and food items professionally and made good suggestions to us. The food quality was excellent and up to our high expectation. At the end of the lunch, complimentary desserts were served, including mini ice-cream cones of different flavors, mini cakes, candies, etc. This was an extra bonus. I had dined at different Chinese restaurants (both with and without Michelin star ratings) in Macau, this is so far the best dining experience I have had."

Every detail, from the delivery of service, the selection of teas, to the design and preparation of dishes, is meticulously looked after. Overall I would say it is the best Cantonese restaurant in Macau at this time. If I were a Michelin assessor, I would certainly award Jade Dragon with the Three Stars that they deserve.

Currently they are awarded Two Stars."

Do try their signature jade dumpling which is one of the best we tried.

Service is excellent."
1036,Punsri21,Bangkok,Thailand,28-January-2017,"This is my first time trying restaurant which I have heard about her for long time. She is one of the busiest restaurant in Macau. The place is extremely beautiful with great decoration. The service is very good but the price is quite high but not beyond expectation. Somehow, I have ordered quite a number of dishes such as snake soup, fried Wagyu beef including her signature goose. I might say that the foods are not as good as you expected of two Michelin Stars."
1037,Justin9127,None,None,10-January-2017,"Jade Dragon is located inside the City of Dreams Hotel, where the ambience at that time of period is not that good due to the renovation of the walls of the entire City of Dreams building. Due to construction period at lunch time, the workers create noise which is somewhat problematic for us to savor our delicious lunch in the restaurant. The meal, however, was excellent. The dim-sums were fresh and the fried rice was nicely made for people to fully enjoy and delight their taste buds. The service could have been improved, for they did not treat us to their best of their ability, and lacks the helpfulness and kindness towards us. The price of the foods was quite expensive and somewhat not worth the high price. Overall a delicious lunch but some aspects could have been further improved to enhance performance."
1038,Immortalist,None,None,5-January-2017,"I've tried a lot of dimsum and fine dining Chinese places here in Macau, and while they vary in number of stars, Jade Dragon is still the best one of them all to date. Every dish is impeccable, even down to the tea they serve and the XO sauce! I'd recommend going for their dimsum at lunch as it's delicious yet reasonably priced, and then go for the a la carte menu during dinner time. Skip the typical super expensive market price stuff and really test out their skills in cooking by ordering actual cooked dishes. Their goose is the best I've tried in the region and their staffs are knowledgeable about the products. They are also understanding and accommodating in terms of the guests' dining preferences, including deboning the poultry when requested. And while I'm not a dessert person, Jade Dragon's desserts deliver well above expectations as well - just their petite fours are noteworthy! If you're looking for a true finedining experience with delicious and authentic Chinese dishes, look no further than Jade Dragon! It was definitely 2-Michelin stars well deserved!"
1039,samuraigun,None,None,31-December-2016,"Top quality Cantonese cuisine. Must try their roasted goods, as they have their own stove, so you can taste the lychee wood on the roast goose skin. Also their char siu is good quality using iberico pork."

Moreover, their staff are polite and helpful in assisting.

1047,383sharonl,Singapore,None,30-July-2016,"Called the restaurant to make reservation and they don't welcome kids below 6 years old. So I had to leave my baby with the nanny in hotel. This is my second time to the restaurant. It looks less good from my first visit 4 years ago. I like the French oysters. The lychee wood roast. The complementary dessert spoils it. Seriously for a Michelin 2 star, that dessert sucks. Don't roll some tasteless starch and call it dessert. I left feeling too full and disgusted. Most Michelin star restaurant makes me feel full and will come back for more."
1048,CaraMia820,Ho Chi Minh City,Vietnam,18-July-2016,"It was a brilliant idea to have a dim sum lunch there, definitely will be back whenever back to Macau.

Restaurant itself has very elegant deco, service is swift with professional manner, friendly and thoughtful.

Ordered some highlight dimsum and 1 set lunch, all the food are delicious and surprised price is very reasonable.

The location is bit far away from the Wynn hotel we stay, and took some time to find this restaurant for us coz its hidden in a mall, but the tasty food made us forget all the inconvenience. And the sweet combination at the end is so sweet touch for us, love it!

Very nice experience, will visit again!"
1049,Parisa_a_Paris,Bangkok,Thailand,4-July-2016,"This is a real Cantonese culinary gem in Macau! We planned to have a light, brief lunch but ended up spending over three hours enjoying ourselves so much with delectable dishes that were so comfortingly familiar yet being so original and creative, like the lychee wood roasted Iberico pluma char sui or the bright jade color Alaskan crab and prawn har gao - to name just a few. We also really enjoyed the wide and fine selections of Chinese tea offered and prepared by a tea sommelier (our pick being the osmanthus scented tieguanyin which was heavenly aromatic). We also had the opportunity to meet with the genius two Michelin-Star head chef, Tam Kwok Fung, who, despite his world class reputation in the Chinese cuisine circuit, was so down-to-earth and genuinely embraced his work with passion - selecting only the best ingredients from around the world and cooking them up with experienced precision. He even sent us so many complimentary desserts (among them, the Sesamisu (black sesame tiramisu) and the Hokkaido milk egg tarts were so divine!) and personally showed us around the place. The restaurant's luxury ambience and services were superlative. Definitely my most favorite Chinese eatery right now!"
1050,Mehri13,Paris,France,22-June-2016,"It was based on a friend recommendation that we discovered this incredibly beautiful restaurant hidden in a luxurious shopping mall in Macao. It was nominated among the 100 best in the world with two Michelin stars. Its Director of Culinary Operation or the Chef Tam Kwok Fung was readily available to guide us through various hidden corners of the space kept for groups or individual dinning. Wine collections were commendable and the decoration was tasteful and luxurious! Our selection of a la carte was calligraphed by a resident artist and presented to us in a beautiful rapping at the end of the meal. Very unique gesture. Chef Tam suggested for our next visit a personalised food sampling of all varieties presented on the menu to give a better appreciation of what the very well organised kitchen can offer. I found this experience thrilling but I wish the Chef could do a bit better on presentation of the main dishes!? As a matter of fact I, with no hesitation made a few pictures of the deserts which were uniquely presented but not from the starter or the main food. I must say the glamorous setting of this restaurant justify this expectation. Having said that, I must add that this little short coming does not say anything about the delicious tastes of what was served."
1051,Annie C,None,None,17-May-2016,"The Jade Dragon has a grand interior décor accompanied with a refined touch of Cantonese cuisine.

Perhaps, I went with an over-expectation. Finally, the private dinner we had, with a customized menu that fits my husband's taste, did not really surprise me. We had the best sellers like char siu (bbq pork), Peking roast duck, double-boiled soup, etc. There is nothing that doesn't taste good, but there is also not one single dish that I must go back for.

The staff are friendly, attentive, and professional which are indeed quite rare in the service industry in Macao now."
1052,GluttonOfTruth,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,24-April-2016,"Jade Dragon is simply one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever dined at.

There's a luxurious elegance and simplicity upon entering the establishment and given the often-used dragon theme in Asian cuisine they really do it differently in a good way.

I enjoy ambiance and decor but they take a back seat to the food itself which is exceptional.

Each dish is a piece of art and is a mouthful of wonderful. I'm constantly trying to find new things to try as it's a great surprise every time.

I have this growing dislike for fancy restaurants which are more focused on appearance than taste.

There's no problem at Jade Dragon which has amazing looking food, the highest quality produce and ingredients, with chefs that know how to make magical combinations.

Dinners can become very expensive especially if it's accompanied by alcohol. If you want to give it a trial first then I suggest lunch which is significantly more affordable.

Customer service is probably a 4.5/5 that just falls short of the elite competition but I'm really being nitpicky here. Whenever I want to show off Macau I'll surely be taking them to Jade Dragon."
1053,LegendLau,None,None,15-April-2016,"Must try the barbecue pork. Forget about the Spanish iberico, try the barbecue pork in its classic fatty style. You'll love it. I would also recommend the Jade Dragon Fried Rice and the almond sweet soup as dessert."

Did not disappoint, the food and service was spectacular and if you are in Macau don't miss this experience . from the moment you walk in the door it was exotic and sophisticated and such an elegant dining experience. From the lychee woodfired chicken with truffle, to the pan fried prawns in Japanese pumpkin cream, it was delightful, and the petit fours made an extremely beautiful complement to end the dining feast."
1059,pv2105,None,None,4-January-2016,"Very delicious. Don't expect to find  Ha gow  or  Shu mai  in the menu. The menu are different from normal dim sum restaurants but we ordered chef's recommendation and they are all very delicious. Will definitely come back again."
1060,VinceVW,Singapore,None,1-January-2016,"Booked a table for 5 of us for lunch 3 weeks before we arrived in Macau. They replied quickly and gave us a nice table.

The decoration is 1st class. Very posh and nice with a big jade at the entrance of the restaurant. They also have many nice tea pots and a good view of the kitchen where they roast their famous Char Siew, Roast Pork and Roast Goose.

The table settings is grand and their service is excellent. It is the most luxurious restaurant we have been to.

Now the food. We ordered some dim sum, Double boil soup and char siew. They surprised us by giving us a free samplier to open our pallets. They took time to explain to us each dish. It was indeed great. Each dim sum dish comes with an element of surprise in its presentation and taste. It tells how much effort the cook puts into the selection of the freshest ingredients and to its presentation.

We enjoyed all the food and it's artistic presentation and also the great service by the service team. It is indeed the best dinning experience we have. A must visit."

1065,foreverbrightchina,shenzhen china,None,18-September-2015,"First the hits: the service and decor are very good. It's a nice space and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Of the dishes we ordered the Lychee wood smoked pork was excellent but I'm not sure that I believe, as they tell us, that it's served on a 5000 year old plank of wood. I'm not sure what flavour Lychee wood is supposed to impart to meat when it's cooking- not Lychees anyway. I think this is a bit of marketing BS.

The miss was unfortunately the most expensive dish we ordered- wasabe beef. Maybe the chef was heavy handed with the wasabe. Maybe its supposed to taste like sucking from a tube of wasabe paste. Anyway, any taste of what should have been and probably was delicious wagyu beef was lost under the pungent taste of wasabe."
1066,NorthStar428355,None,None,16-August-2015,"I had dim sum in this restaurant only once, and maybe My disappointing experience only depends on some accidental circumstances. Anyway, drillings and other noises ruined my lunch (renovations? Wouldn't it be better to advice the clients at the time of the booking?). Besides the terrible noise, i found that the place is by far overpriced! I go for dim sum very often and usually I don't mind paying more for starred places, however, for my first time, I found the bill truly unfair. And the food? Good but not enough to justify the price. Service very good."
1067,Henrikas P,None,None,11-August-2015,"I would say - nothing special. Yes, the service is impeccable, but the food is not memorable, check zapomnils 1500mop) a lot of pathos, without which you can do without. Stars is fine - but no charm at the restaurant."
1068,Bbqbbq2014,Singapore,Singapore,2-August-2015,"Although the service was immaculate and the dishes looked fantastic, the food was rather disappointing. I have tried the other michelin starred Eight at Lisboa which I feel the food was outstanding (but the service level of staff was not as good as Jade Dragon).

Loved the free dessert which made up for the disappointing dimsum.

We ordered about 6 dimsum and 3 soups for 2 persons. .The best were the lobster bisque with blue lobster dumpling and the Abalone puff."

The dim sum were all freshly made. We ordered the  slice skin goose , it is a goose which is not found at most restaurants as ducks would usally be served instead of ducks. Service is good. It is kind of luxury. Try the goose! The dersert looks better than most western restaurant and it is yummy icecream!"

1073,tripplebang,Singapore,Singapore,6-June-2015,"Wow... In looking for a dining experience after seeing the House of the Dancing Waters show (5stars), we were treated to a dining experience unlike any other at Jade Dragon.

Upon entry our hostess walked us past the kitchens explaining each one and to a beautiful dining area, with a glass dragon on each table.

Our hostess guided us through the menu, offering to reduce portion sizes to allow us to experience a larger Rangel of their signature dishes. Goose and pork that were stunning, soups that were unlike any we have experienced before and the petit fours after the meal just rounded off the experience.

To top it off they presented us a copy of our menu written in a card by their calligrapher, and gave us a copy of the Michelin star guide to Hong Kong and Macau.

Great evening and great experience."
1074,marcoaL4444TV,None,None,23-March-2015,"Great experience! Exceptional service, excellent design, great food! Best experience if you decide for Chinese food! A must!!"
1075,Edyharto,Singapore,Singapore,19-March-2015,"I heard of Michelin-star restaurant only recently when my friend told us that her daughter has booked one for our meal in City of Dreams, Macau. Not expecting too much as older persons who ate the worst and the best food around, we were surprised when our host led us to a private room, the “Forever Harmonious Palace” of the Jade Dragon Restaurant of COD….The elegant ambience of the place was peaceful and heavenly. Sitting space may be a problem in Hong Kong, but here at this marvelous tastefully decorated restaurant, the table before us, perhaps meant for ten diners, was huge for the five of us. This was fine dining fit for a king!
As soon as we were seated, the appetizer or was it the salad, red small tomatoes served on a “smoking” bowl by a beautiful Chinese waitress who went on to explain the dish. However, our focus was firmly on the nicely presented food, not the explanation and each of us quickly started eating the steamed or was it braised or boiled tomatoes placed on transparent jelly. It was a fantastic starter! The dishes were then served as quickly as we finished eating the last ones or even before that and we were struggling to find space in our already filled tummy.
Years ago, we went to Beijing for an “Emperor’s meal”, but that meal really paled in comparison to the delectable and tantalizing food at Jade Dragon Restaurant in the COD. Some of the fusion food here was created by Master Chef Tam Kwok Fung, who honored us with his appearance. A humble-looking man, he went on to explain some of the dishes. Again, our focus was affixed to the food and no sooner he finished the explanation, we started eating it. This is one fine dining where we put formality to one side.
Three excellent dishes deserve mention - the lychee-wood roasted char-siew and goose, the red grouper fish-slices and the fried rice, which has the best aroma and fragrance I experienced. The other dishes including “Siow Long Bao”, the entrees and the desserts, all nicely presented are good. As one reviewer said, it is worth visiting at least once in a lifetime, this being an excellent restaurant serving high quality and pricey food. We are full of gratitude and very thankful to our host for giving us this once-in-a-life time opportunity and look forward to a return."
1076,NomSutipolC,Bangkok,Thailand,31-January-2015,"Plenty of choices for dimsim. All pretty nice, fancy and flexible. I was there by myself and could order by number of pieces. Definitely a plus.

Ordered 2 lobster dumplings, 1 beef puff, 1 rice roll, 2 crab dumplings, a small serve of BBQ pork. As mentioned I was there by myself and wanted to try the BBQ pork so the staff helped to organise a small dish for me.

Taste good, great service in an elegant atmosphere. Quite pricey though. Total MOP 640.20"
1077,chillipadichua,Singapore,Singapore,18-December-2014,"This Michelin-star restaurant certainly lives up to its name in terms of ambience and food.

The lychee-wood char-siew is nicely charred with balanced amount of fats and simply melts in the mouth - after tasting this, you are bound to want to return.

Worth visiting at least once in a lifetime"

1079,AlbusD,Singapore,Singapore,26-June-2014,"My family of six had our dinner here to celebrate a birthday.
Upon entering, one can feel the elegant environment with large chairs and ample space between tables which is not typical in chinese restaurants.
We had roasted pork belly and char siew(roasted pork loin) which was juicy and crispy. To me, these common chinese food where you can find in almost any chinese food outlet is a measure of the quality of ingredients, cooking and attention to details that provides the differentiation. The suckling pig on foie gras and prawn on lobster biseque gravy were not only unqiue but exquisite in its tasts. The signature fried rice lived up to its expectation. All in all, we coulnd't fault the high quality of food.
The service was also excellent from food recommendation to constant refilling of tea.
Since this is a fine dining chinese restaurant, the price was as expected higher than the usual above average chinese restuarant but i personally find the price pretty reasonable given the quality of food, decor of the restaurant and great service!
Will certainly return on the next opportunity to try the other food itmes on the menu."
1080,rustybucket50,Chinatown,Singapore,19-June-2014,"A hidden gem: well deserved Michelin-starred restaurant!

We have tried the 3 stars Michelin chinese restaurant in Hong Kong; so were not expecting too much from Jade Dragon. However it was full of surprise: very attractive presentation on most dishes, delicious BBQ pork, freshly made xiao long bao and lastly, the complimentary desserts which ended our meal perfectly."
1081,MerryJetterSingapore,Singapore,None,17-June-2014,"Jade Dragon came highly recommended. So we had lunch on 15 June. Restaurant is tastefully decorated- not gaudy as in lots of Chinese restaurants. We had a pte room. We ordered quite a number of items, in double or triple orders cos we had 10pax. Memorable dim sum dishes were cheong funs (thin rice rolls) wif prawns, n a Mui Choy (lightly sweet preserved vegetable) n pork stuffing, bolo buns (char siu stuffy), flaky yam n scallop puffs. We also ordered some a la carte items- crispy rice in lobster broth, iberico pork char siu (very good), roast goose (crispy skin n meat is moist), stir fry noodles in lightly sweet soy sauce n lard (good). Desserts that we had were interestingly 'non-Chinese' - milk tea, lemon 'ice cream cones', macarons n chocolates... Like most reviewers' comments, it's fairly pricey. But worth a try."
1082,NellWang,Hsinchu,Taiwan,15-June-2014,"I have never tasted a plate of stir-fried vegetables with such ridiculous price, even more than some of their meat dishes.

1085,Flore_yeung,None,None,26-January-2014,"The place is almost always fully booked, so we had to call in and book a day in advance for a dinner reservation.

The place is beautifully decorated and on the way to the dining area, you will pass by the roasting pit and food preparation counter behind a glass. At dinner, there will also be a Caligraphy master at a special counter whom (we discovered at the end of our dinner) actually writes a beautiful caligraphy card of our dinner menu, tied with a small piece of coin jade and this is provided to the dining guest as a complimentary gift, and we were thrilled!

Our waitress (Yami) was very polite and took the patience to explain (with a sweet smile) every detail of the food item which we inquired about and she was very helpful in providing suggestions for us which allowed us to try a variety of their signature dishes and the portion was just nice.

Usually at chinese restaurants, you will occasionally have to request for refill of tea, but here i hardly ever had an empty tea cup for more than 2 minutes :) Definitely a plus point experience

At the end of the main course, Yami approached us with the Desserts Menu and we selected two desserts for sharing. But she served us additional 3 desserts! and this was provided complimentary from the Restaurant! Oh My... we were up in the stars... the desserts we nicely done, not too sweet and we noted that you will taste all 5 flavors in the variety of dessert! (sour from lemon, sweet, spicy from ginger sweets, salty from our main dish already - so skip this and bitter from a mix of herbal stuff)

They serve very good variety of tea (they also have tea bar as opposed to liquor bar) :) Yami then walked us to the door and making sure that we had all our things with us and checked if everyone was ok and explained more on the glass encased kitchen as we passed by....

We Are So Coming Back!

The price is not exorbitantly high, its definitely worth a try :)"
1086,WhaleCruiser,Japan,None,30-April-2013,"Went for lunch to check out the restaurant. The dim sum items were by far the best in town. The lobster xiao long bao was the best one which was made to order and served in a cute little bowl. The service staff were okay in general but when we asked questions about some of the dishes, in stead of trying to find out, they just guessed what it was so we had to ask the manager the same question.
A bit pricy but would go back."

We took a cab from Gongbei port, cost us RMB10 for a 10mins ride.It was a Monday noon but lobby was packed with ppl at the waiting area and we actually waited 45mins for the seats.
We ordered their signature roasted goose and requested not to have breast meat and it turned out to be small portion with all bones, hardly get to really taste the meat and their steam pork ribs with too much fats too.Other dishes that we ordered were also so so only, no satisfaction for this meal."

We arrived about 1:45pm on a Sunday and only had to wait about 5 minutes. English is sparse but reception were helpful to explain the ticketing system and showed us where to wait.

The restaurant is clearly a local favourite with lots of families and large groups. The menu was not in English but the waitress quickly produced an English menu on an iPad. The food was delicious, the staff attentive and definitely worth the trip over from Macau."
1098,Bigtoebobby,Seattle,Washington,18-October-2018,"We had dinner here. I don't know about the Dim Sum menu. Take 4 fantastically cooked Chinese dishes made with the freshest ingredients. Now, dump an entire shaker of salt into each one. Now dump in a second shaker of salt. That's the food here. It's beyond salty. Its unedible. I'm not sure if its a style of Chinese cooking I've never heard of, or just this restaurant's shtick. Its frustrating because you can see that under all the salt, there are some wonderful dishes there. But no, after a few bites, you just can't go on.

I'm sure the saltiness is intentional. When I asked the waiter for advice on this or that menu item, she described each as good if you like salty ( Xian ). So, they know.

I don't know, maybe there are some non-salty dishes on the menu, or you can order them without the salt, if you find yourself having to eat here."

It consistently serves the best seafood without like they're skimping on portions. Yes if you eat here you're gonna spend money, that's a given. But you'll also get premium quality, which is also a given here. Best thing to do is go to the seafood market style section of the restaurant and pick out your live seafood. Taste is perfection! Don't forget to order the daily soup, which is always simmered for the better part of the day."
1105,calidomca,Orange County,California,23-February-2017,"This is my favorite restaurant in Zhuhai so far.
The waiter service is friendly and well trained.
However the manager should put on a friendly smile as well. The semi bold headed manager with curly hair has a frozen face. His facial expression was so unfriendly till It makes the customer uncomfortable.
The workers that scoop out the live
seafood for you, are impatient and rude.
We wanted a smaller Soon hock fish and he gave us a giant one, when we ask him to change it into a smaller one, he packed the fish and throw it into the basket and asks us what we want next?
When we told him to ditch the half dead shrimp and he throws the shrimps on the floor and pinch their tummys and told us that the shrimps were perfectly fine. It was just plain rude .

Roasted piglet, pork and goose tasted amazing. The skin is crispy, the meat is juicy, it's tasty and not too oily or chunky. Hands down the best for their roasted meats.
The portion is a bit too small.

Clam in fermented soy bean is fresh, sweet and tasty.

Steamed Soon Hock fish in simply soy sauce was a bit over cooked. That's the reason why I told him to get a smaller sized fish. It's still yummy, but not perfect.

Cold chicken feet in spicy sauce is another amazing work. The chicken feet is tasty and not too soft. The sauce is sour and spicy, but not overly salted.

Mantis shrimp topped with fried garlic is chewy, dry, definitely over cooked and not too fresh. Some of them were belly up in the tank. No more prego mantis shrimp in the future.

Durian pastry is another amazing creation. Mr.Q who doesn't eat Durian at all, ate two of them. The skin dough is beautifully made in layers, it's tiny, but the Durian filling is hot and the pastry skin is crispy.

We will definitely come back to try more stuff.

5 star for the food
5 star for the waiter service
5 star for the atmosphere
3 star for the order system (it was a mess, totally no system at all)

1106,pauljer,Singapore,Singapore,14-January-2017,"This restaurant has palatial interiors. Fortunately, the same can’t be said for its prices, which are value for money. It’s surprisingly affordable. I cannot vouch for my soul but the time I visit this restaurant I cannot help but feel happy and satisfied. Everything, from the fresh ingredients to the presentation is spot-on.

Make sure you sample the barbeque pork in honey sauce. This is some of the barbecue pork I’ve had in a long time. Don’t miss the baked prawn in sea urchin sauce. The texture is very rich and buttery. It tastes like nothing I have ever eaten before in my life. The sweet and sour prawn with hawthorn sauce was also well executed.

If you are in Zhuhai and want somewhere to enjoy a cheerful meal with friends, look no further. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
1107,LinShanfu,Singapore,Singapore,20-November-2016,"We visited this restaurant on a Sunday without prior reservation and we had to wait for approximately 45 minutes, so do remember to call and make a reservation before heading down. The dim sum selection was extensive and the food did not disappoint. Food was served warm, and we loved everything that we had ordered. Would love to return for another visit if time permits! In total, our bill added up to about 200RMB ($35USD~). From our perspective, we felt that this was reasonable given the quality of the food and setting."
1108,Audio G,London,None,13-November-2016,"Doesn't open early so arrive after 8AM if you are coming for Dim Sum, enormous selection of very well prepared food. Over the years this has grown into an impressive multi story restaurant and if its not breakfast then come for lunch or dinner. Lovely views out over Zhuhai bay and the new bridge even if you can't get a window seat the view is still accessible."
1109,Groundnuts,Singapore,Singapore,31-May-2016,"The is the second time I came to this place for dinner. The dishes were of high standards and good quality. Price is high but worth. Particularly like its fried rice, dessert, kind like a fried pancake. Crispy skin and very tasty. They also serve one of the best tim sum during the day."
1110,joykoo,Singapore,Singapore,25-April-2016,"Was there for dim sum on a Sunday morning. Quite crowded but very orderly wait. We were last here about 10 years ago and the taste of the food and service did not change much. However a drawback is that they have done away with the menu in English. So by not able to read Chinese it is not that easy to order. Resorted to get the order taker to recommend. Luckily she is patient despite the crowd in the restaurant. As a result we still enjoyed our dim sum. Below are only some of the photos."
1111,alfredgxma,None,None,14-March-2016,"Enough car park, good location, good Cantonese food,Service is not as good as few years ago, the price is lower than before, more suitable for the public instead of only the rich and the VIP."
1112,alvinloy,None,None,1-March-2016,"Arrived at 10:45am and was informed waiting time is 20 minutes but was given a table in 10 minutes.
Restaurant totally packed on a Wednesday morning.

Nice view with entire restaurant facing the ocean and new bridge linking Hong Kong.

I have been to this restaurant many years ago and recalled that I had a very pleasant dining experience here.
Revisiting this restaurant today, I feel that this restaurant is overrated.
Besides the nice ambience and great view, the food is average."

1117,Tom Y,Las Vegas,Nevada,9-December-2014,"Came here for lunch on a weekday around 1PM. Good crowd but seated right away. One of the better Dim Sum place I've been to in China. Everything we ordered were good. Price was a bit high for Zhuhai. It has nice scenery facing the ocean.
Service was great, the place was clean"
1118,PatchesH57,New York,None,17-November-2014,"I went to this place with a few co-workes (one of whom is fluent in Chinese and did the ordering).

The place was busy, but we were seated immediately when we arrived at 6:30 PM on a Wednesday night. Apparently they do not take reservations, so I would guess much later there will be a queue.

We had several very interesting dishes. We had crispy pig (roast pork belly?), which had an tasty crsipy skin and very tender pork. The Baked prawns with sea urchin sauce was excellent. We also had the deep fried pork and crab dumplings which were crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside.

As a sweet we had a pineapple dumpling which was delicious. It looked like a steamed dumpling on the outside, but had a pineapple flavored custard with bits of fruit inside.

I love chinese cooking, but this was apparently a cantonese style which was mildly seasoned (some time the Szechuan is just too much for me).

Service was excellent and the place was very nice condition. It can be a bit noisy, but we sat against the wall so it was not to bad. If I went again, I would try to get a seat near the window which overlooks the water."
1119,happyanngel,None,None,6-June-2014,"The place was grand... we went on a weekday around 11am.. really happy that we came.. cos the food were fantastic & my family love the scenary as well... The abalone siew mai must order.. really delicious. Service were great..."

1121,BryanHuangPFS,Singapore,Singapore,15-January-2014,"I should have wrote a review for JYX back when I thought it was worth 5 stars but better late than never?

Their star dim sum IMHO would be their Liu Sha Bao and their XO Turnip Cake. I've had dimsum at Tim Ho Wan (Not their flagship store) & the Eight (3 Michelin Stars) and thought that the Liu Sha Bao here is comparable if not slightly better.

I think this is still my go-to place for hotpot be it in Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai. Splurge a little on Geoduck (whelk) and lobster sashimi and turn the harder parts of the Geoduck into a delicious congee. The restaurant procures fresh seafood and their seafood do not have a stench unlike certain types of seafood that has a bad smell to it in most restaurants in south east Asia."
1122,reachablepar3,Chicago,Illinois,3-January-2014,"The comments about the crowds are true but it's lunchtime the 1st of January so 45 minutes for a table is ok since we can cross the road and walk by the sea in the sunshine. I'm no dim sum expert but the flavors are clean and distinct. The honey-glazed pork is so beautiful - sweet and unctuous but not cloying. Would recommend to anyone."
1123,LVN-SJ,California,United States,12-November-2013,"I love to eat and if you love good dim sum and savory seafood Chinese dishes, you will love this place.

When I visit Zhuhai, even though I might stay for 10 days, I will actually eat here at least 3 or 4 times each stay.

The best food ever."
1124,Stevewonders,None,None,3-January-2020,"The interior designed is a retro 60s and is very pleasing.The price is more expensive than other Chinese dim sum restaurants but less than restaurants inside major casinos such as Galaxy Parisian.

1125,babe_chau,None,None,17-April-2019,"Recommended by a friend so made a visit to this famous Chinese restaurant. Staffs are all attentive and Din Sums are excellent! Should try their fried rice with roasted pork and shrimp paste too. The price is also reasonable!"

1141,kentkflee,Malaysia,None,31-August-2013,"Went there for the first time with friends. It is located near to Altira if I could recalled. Home style cooking. If you enjoyed something mild, this is the place. You either like it or hate it. For the price, you have too many choices nowadays....."
1142,Bwkuah,None,None,5-November-2012,"Nice meal, shark fins soup not that good but all the other basic dishes excellent, nice steamed sole, all the other house specialities worked well. Basic traditional Cantonese, looks like from the 70s, it's all about the food. Good wine selection."
1143,AnimaBella,Singapore,Singapore,16-August-2012,"Very good place for Dim sum and Chinese food. The food is true and honest, not overly decorated... nothing like rabbit looking dim sum, cutie siew mai,.. etc... The food is just great, great taste and fresh. This place is not very prominent and inside a lane, the best way to find it is go to Altira hotel and this restaurant is right behind it. I have been coming to this restaurant again and again... oh ya.. forgot to mention.. the food is very reasonable price.
I always order for dim sum menus and never had any disappointing experience.
Be prepared for a massive queue!"
1144,GerardWW,None,None,10-August-2012,"great food, reasonable prices and authentic. Popular with locals and Hong Kongers, ... not so easy to find but worth the effort. It is located behind Altira Hotel. Be prepared to queue on Sunday...!"

Fantastic value with the bill being half of any casino chinese restaurant. Dim sum is the way to go here"
1146,Naddito,Dubai,United Arab Emirates,6-March-2020,"The venue is always packed so I recommend you have a reservation a few weeks in advance. I managed to get in without a reservation on their last table but the issue was that they have mostly a package meal that is not vegetarian. So I was eating the only vegetarian dish they had, which dampened the experience a bit. Other than that everything was excellent, from staff to facilities and of course, the view."
1147,Janity,Berlin,None,13-January-2020,"I won't pretend the location and setting aren't relevant - of course they are.
So, you're in Macao, right on the strip (one of the strips, I should say), in one of the most dazzling buildings, The Parisian's  Eiffel Tower , enjoying Chinese food.
The place is lovely, with a nice view to boot.
The food is great - authentic-ish Chinese/Cantonese food, with just enough not too  out there  items on the menu for even relatively unexperienced Westerners to enjoy. (Our apologetic request for silverware was promptly and most graciously followed, btw.)
The food was very well prepared, with a bit of a twist here and there and an unpretentious hint of fine dining.
The staff were fantastic, trying their best to accomodate us and to communicate in English, very attentive and kind. There were three to four people fluttering around us most of the time, without being annoying or giving you the feeling of being watched, though.
The prices are very fair, given the location and the quality of the food.
There's even a complimentary dessert (presented in a cloche with dry ice for effect), that put a perfect ending to a perfect dinner.
I wholeheartedly recommend this place.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"
1148,cherrym1109,None,None,15-December-2019,"The wok-fried prime beef in black pepper sauce is a must try, the candied walnut is so good and the beef is very tender, my partner and I love it very much!

Highly recommend."
1155,Dinotoni,None,None,2-October-2019,"We had a very nice experience in La Chine at Parisian Hotel last week. A server welcomed us to the seat and observed my sister was wearing a sleeveless dress and gave her a scarf proactively since the air-con is a little bit cold. During the dining, all servers introduced the dishes when serving and asked us about the feedback of the taste. At the end, we requested to take some pics in this fabulous restaurant which is located at the Eiffel Tower on the Macau Cotai-strip, the captain called  Kun  did a very a good job and took very nice pictures for our memories. He is a professional staff to complete our excellent dining that night. Highly recommend La Chine to tourist when travelling Macau, especially for who wanna spend the holiday and special moment with families and lovers."
1156,235sherryy,Singapore,Singapore,30-September-2019,"Decided to try this restaurant as it was one of the top rated restaurants on TripAdvisor, and it did not disappoint - the service by John was remarkable! He impressed us with his knowledge of each dish and his great sense of humor, making our dining experience very comfortable and unforgettable. He is truly the embodiment of great service and I cannot thank him enough for this :)

We ordered the honey glazed pork and vegetarian starters which were delicious, but the goose liver dish was slightly less appetizing. The restaurant was also beautifully decorated and situated inside the Eiffel tower. Would be great if the dishes were slightly more tilted towards the French palette."

1159,Iris Bettina E,None,None,14-September-2019,"We had our first dinner here when we arrived in Macau. They had fairly good service and our main server was mindful of our needs. The food tasted good specially the Canard a l’ orange duck. They even gave us complimentary dessert! The restaurant was quite nice and had a beautiful view. Don’t forget to request to sit by the window when you reserve. The only downside was that they weren’t as strict in implementing the “smart casual” attire but that’s not entirely their fault that the diners just don’t know how to dress appropriately."
1160,Woodylim,Singapore,Singapore,13-September-2019,"One of my best lunch in Macau. The Beef Rib is superb. One of the best I ever had. Juicy and Tender.

1162,RichardC733,null,Hong Kong,22-August-2019,"If I was just rating the food, I would give it 3 or 4 stars. It’s ok. But was elevated (pun intended) was the wonderful service from our waiter John, the views of the nighttime neon wonderland that is the Cotai strip and the ambience of this mock Parisian restaurant. The restaurant itself is on the 6th floor of the hotel, inside the imitation structure of the Eiffel Tower. But what makes this place a pleasant experience rather than a corny one is the quality design of the restaurant decor and materials. The walk along the sky bridge to the tower through a hallway of mirrors and windows is most impressive. The iron work structures within the restaurant seem quite impractical for the waiting staff who have to duck and squeeze through the spaces to serve guests. I joked that maybe they should be given helmets to protect themselves!

What really made this a great night for us though was the extra care and attention we received from our waiter and the rest of the staff. Excellent service, very kind, very well groomed and nice singing voices when singing ‘Happy Birthday!”"
1163,RuttersCouple,Venezuela,None,20-August-2019,"The ambiance was perfect. Good food even the wine as awesome! A bit pricey compared to other restaurants but you pay extra for the parisian view.The staff was nice as well. You just need to get a reservation because most of the time it is fully booked."
1164,E8638MUrobertos,Trento,Italy,16-August-2019,"Great view inside the  Tour Heifel , great location but the food, supposedly high cousine, was not worth the otrogeous price."
1165,sweethearttheclown,Singapore,None,6-August-2019,"The whole experience of going into La Chine was magical. We went in through the shopping center into a private lift and walkway, which led us directly into La Chine, which is built on the Eiffel Tower itself. The day we went was a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn’t crowded at all.

Every dish was a delight, including the amuse bouche which was a plum powder covered cherry tomato with its skin peeled off. Every dish was a delight till the Wagyu Beef, which turned out medium instead of medium rare. When I was ordering, I was already worried about the doneness because the waiter thought I said medium well, so I had to repeat and he still got it wrong. My mandarin and Cantonese fantastic either, so I guess it was a problem with our communication.

However, each dish had a surprising element and even the fried rice which was part of the set tasted good, not overly oily and every grain was evenly coated with sauce.

Dessert, by the time we got to it, was going to be forgettable, but no, it was not! Adding coconut ice cream to an otherwise normal mango sago with pomelo was inspired.

Food, ambiance and service - fantastic. I’ll definitely want to return to try the rest of the food."

We ordered the French Discovery Set Dinner.

The trio of appetisers - crispy roast duck, oyster w Szechuan Pepper and mixed seafood salad were very well marinated and delicious.
The scallop in quinoa-pumpkin congee was tasty as was the crab curry croquette.
The highlight was the wok-fried beef with wasabi sauce and walnuts.
The generous portion of bbq foie gras on braised e-fu noodles with mushrooms was a tasty finale.

The La Chine trio dessert platter did not disappoint. In addition my Husband received Chinese BDay buns

We were looking for a casual dining spot with some good view for the dinner. We didn't make reservation so we walked in when we were wandering around the Eiffel Tower. The receptionist was very nice and offered us a table by the window after 5 minute wait. The view and the vibe of the restaurant actually were beyond our expectation after we walked in. We ordered the crab salad as appetizer, seabass, and brew short ribs for our main. I have to say that both seabass and short ribs are prepared perfectly. The seabass was a bit crispy outside and very tender inside, and the short ribs just melt in your mouth because the beef was cooked over 10-hour (according to the waiter) It is probably one of the best seabass and shortribs I have had. The restaurant manager, Kun, is extremely nice that he offered dessert to us after the meal. I then asked if he could do a little celebration for my boyfriend and he immediately said yes and he can arrange something special with a picture taken from the restaurant that I can take it home with us. The overall experience was very pleasant and the service was beyond our expectation that Kun went over and beyond to make sure we had a great birthday celebration. I recommend anyone here for a great dining experience!!"
1187,w204,Honolulu,Hawaii,28-January-2019,"Ever since our family booked the Parisian for our stay, I looked forward in trying their flagship restaurant. La Chine exemplifies what the Parisian Macao is, a fusion of France in China.

We attempted to book a reservation for the same night on a Monday only to be told that the first available reservation was at 9:30pm. Not a problem since we can tour the grounds of the Parisian prior to eating.

I often overlook mistakes as they could happen throughout a dinner service, but when it happens like clockwork and everything they do is a mistake after mistake, it ruins your dinner experience.

The restaurant is incredibly beautiful. From the walkway into the restaurant to the well appointed furniture, this restaurant has potential.

Unfortunately, right as it began, problems arose. Upon check in on the hotel side we informed the counter of our reservation in which we then were pointed to the elevator to the 6th floor. As we walked through the beautiful catwalk area to the reception desk, we were totally ignored by the two working there. One just lifted her hands and pointed into the general direction of the dining area.

As we walked into the dining area, no one greeted us. There were a party after us who were warmly greeted and led to their seats as we just stood there next to the bar looked for at least someone to point to us where our reserved seats were. We let the bartender of this issue and he attempted to help us, but we still waited about 5 minutes blocking a main ingress and egress because no one talked to us.

When we were finally seated, we ordered the French Discovery menu for both of us. The tasting menu indicated clearly that the amuse-bouche was part of what we ordered but when the first dishes came, we never got it.

Then came the clanging of silverware and plates. I understand that there is preparation work to be done an hour before closing but it is utterly annoying when service is just clanging plates and silverware within feet from you. This happened in so many occasions that it ruined our dinner experience . Granted that we had an infant with us, but she was so well behaved that we could have gone to Robuchon with them without any issues.

Next, we were getting next course dishes even before we were a quarter way done with our current dish. It was frustrating to see that we were indeed being rushed out because no competent restaurant would offer a tasting menu and do something like that. We had to let the staff on two occasions on different dishes that we were still working on a current dish and hold off from sending us more dishes. Our hot dish of foie gras was just sitting while we were trying to eat our previous dish and later our dessert was brought when we were eating our foie gras, with ice cream in it and all!

And to annoy us even more, my plate was taken away while my wife was still eating. This is a major problem which any fine dining restaurant needs to train their staff not to do. It was incredibly rude.

Then while we were eating our dessert, a staff member brought us the check. I understand a casual restaurant doing this but it was already an icing on the cake and an obvious gesture trying to rush us out 5 minutes prior to closing.

We settled our checks and let the server know that we never got our amuse-bouche in which he answered that they didn’t have any. Really? Could have told us when we ordered instead of trying to sneak it through.

I’m glad we got to try this at least as we were looking forward to it but this place dropped the ball so hard that I was compelled to write about it. Never again."
1188,henrychoi8,None,None,19-January-2019,"Fabulous and amazing food especially the Dim day . The prawn dumpling is highly recommended for everyone. The staff is very hospitable, which has given me a warm feeling, especially Rebecca, who has served my big family of 13 people from the beginning until the end of the lunch !!"
1189,galacticnick,Singapore,Singapore,29-December-2018,"It would’ve been perfect if not for two minor(?) incidents.

1. We had booked a table by the window, but were first seated all by ourselves in a secluded section, away from the rest who were in the main dining hall. (No, the dining hall was not full.) One might think that’s discriminatory, but I’m sure it’s an innocuous mistake made by a poorly trained server.

Thankfully, one of the servers realised we had not been seated correctly and moved us to the main dining hall shortly after.

Also, we were initially brought all the menus, except for the one for the dim sum. If we had not known better, we would have thought that was all they had.

2. No one asked if we would like to pay in MOP or my home currency, SGD. Everyone knows that paying in the local currency, MOP in this case, is the cheaper option. They took the liberty to decide we should pay in SGD. I realised it only days later when I checked my credit card account online. Not cool.

The food is commendable, but there’s still much room for improvement in terms of service, especially for a fine dining restaurant in a five-star establishment."
1190,HeeraFatimah,Singapore,Singapore,11-December-2018,"We were very Impressed by the unique taste of dim sums that we have ordered.

Unfortunately, the service was Not matched up to the Marvellous food standards.
Hostess wasnt friendly and had a high pitched voice, it almost sounded as though she was screaming.

We were there for lunch, I am sure it will be much more beautiful in the evening.

Good Food for Fine Dining Price!"

The ice lettuce and mushroom salad was very fresh and delightfully crispy. Moving along had a very nice red tea. Final dish was scallops and shrimp sautéed. I am a big fan. Well done."
1195,pierrot188,Saint-Denis,Reunion Island,10-November-2018,"Food was average, far from the price they ask...
The service was a fiasco . We were the only européenne people and we got the waitress who could not speak English!! We ask for to change and she said “yes yes” but nothing changed.
Taking a order on a language you don’t speak is a hard task and of course it wasn’t good. My wife had to eat alone first,(and we are still looking for the ibérique ham on the scallop)
Then I had to eat alone and the waggu wasn’t cooked well. The white wine was warm , 3 members of the staff came to apologize when we just wanted to enjoy the view. They forced us to stay to eat a dessert for free which was nice but a little rough.
So, all in all we left disappointed."
1196,JoeyL1049,None,None,4-September-2018,"Four of us visited this restaurant for a dinner at the beginning of Sep for a friend's pre birthday.

The atmosphere there was excellent,tho we visited on a busy night, we were still able to communicate with each other and had a great experience. The service there was up to standard, staffs there were helpful and polite.

The price is definitely reasonable, we ordered 3 appetizers and 3 main courses and some non alchohol drinks. The chief came out and professionally introduced how to consumed their dishes and made an interaction with us. He integrated some new thought into tradition Guangdong cruisine."
1197,p_morley,Australia,None,3-September-2018,"I can’t rate this restaurant highly enough. The food, atmosphere and service are excellent. We were a party of 6 and decided on the set menu. Every dish was perfect and the variety and portion sizes just right.

I would put it on your must visit list when in Macau"

1200,MachineGunRock,None,None,21-August-2018,"Celebrating our 3rd Anniversary at La Chine today. Below are the good points and the bad points as we observed.

GOOD POINTS
1. Excellent food. Master Chef Fai Goh has prepared some special and delicious vegetarian dishes for me, and mywife too.

2. Great service. Staff are very attentive, properly dressed and helpful. Of course, their manager Queenie definitely leads by example, all taking care of us so well.

3. Comfortable seating near the window. New chairs now, that don't fall over backwards, as done previously.

4. Beautiful decoration of the restaurant with Eiffel Tower structures near us.

BAD POINTS
1. A bit noisy as kids running around the restaurant, usual for summer vacation. Of course, can't banned kids which will reduce sales. Seems to be a  bad parent, bad kids  scenario, which can't be the restaurant's fault, of course.

ADVICE
It is definitely a fine dining place welcoming couples and families. Worth a try."

1204,Sharon K,None,None,14-July-2018,"We have a family at La Chine today for lunch. Everything went well. The food was very good. Until waitress asked our 8 month old baby to keep her voice down, which surprised us. La Chine is a Chinese restaurant but not really considered as “fine dining”. Chinese restaurant is usually noisy. Baby voice is hard to control because she doesn’t understand what situation she was in. If this restaurant wants to have a volume control, maybe should try to put us at a room? Or should have an age limit for customers ? Disappointed not at the food or view, but the service."
1205,Roman R,None,None,1-May-2018,"I love dim sum and had loads of it when visiting China, I really enjoyed this restaurant as the artistry applied to each of the dim sum, other resaturants in Hong Kong where as good taste wise but lacked the style of these."

year we missed the chance to dine in as the restaurant was fully occupied. We came back with family this time, unfortunately the restaurant is closed.

Looking forward to dine in the Eiffel Tower the other side of the world."
1207,Jun S,Manila,Philippines,26-January-2018,"The food at La Chine was great although the service was not as swift as I expected. But the crew was courteous enough. I was expecting a grand view while dining but it was quite ordinary. As a whole, it was worth for a first time visit...."

Not only does each dish look beautiful, the flavors are excellent, Chef Chung Kuy Fai uses his global experience to create dishes that are appealing to the eye and to the mouth. Every dish is a feast for the eyes! The dessert featuring almond tofu, black sesame ball and fruit was dynamic! We will definitely come back to the Parisian just to have Chef Fai's dishes again!"
1212,CBHK88,HK,None,29-October-2017,"We had a wonderful evening, made so by the food and excellent service and commentary provided by the Maitre de, Quennie. That said, the service was at times erratic, and only under Queenie’s direct involvement, did things go well.

Firstly, on arrival we were seated next to a recently vacated table that had not been cleared. It was extremely messy, food spread all over, and most unpleasant. No attempt was made to clear this until a specifically requested it. Quennie stepped in and immediately found us another table, while her staff seemed to scurry behind us to clear the offending table.

Secondly, while we head three separate service staff topping up our glasses of water, no one seemed at all interested in taking our food order. Requests to the wait staff, resulted in lots of apologies and directions to other staff, but still no one taking our order

Again, Quennie to the rescue, order taken, and the star of the night, the food, started to roll in.

The food was simply exceptional. We had the tasting menu, each course meticulously prepared, and an innovative and enjoyable fusion of local Chinese food and flavours, with a French twist. Each course exceeded expectations, with desert being the masterpiece.

Quennie took over service and personally introduced each course, the ingredients and commentary on preparation. This greatly enhanced the experience.

So, in summary, service had some glitches, but Quennie and the food, made it a good experience. Highly recommend."
1213,Mattjack8,Singapore,None,28-October-2017,"This was an impulse visit was killing time before the airport and visited the viewing platform. Was hoping for French food but found amazing dim sum & tea and friendly accommodating staff.

1216,Jack L,None,None,11-October-2017,"From the moment we were escorted to our table, to the moment we left, the attention to detail was second to none.
We experienced probably the best entrance to a restaurant you could imagine. Walking across a glass stair way from the Parisian to the Eiffel Tower.
The tasting menu was exquisite and the atmosphere, which resembles the inside of the restaurant 58 Eiffel Tower, gives a experience that will never be forgotten.
I don't normally write reviews but it should be mentioned that this restaurant is worth the trip if you are visiting Hong Kong and wondering whether you should go to the Macau or not . I believe the dining experience is well worth the trouble.
Thank you to Queenie and all your staff. We had a wonderful day which the gents will be talking about for a long time to come. Next time we will bring our wives.

Regards

Jack L."

Just have to give the best compliment on the outstanding service, staffs here are very caring and they know what to suggest. Great pick on the wine by Queennie, very nice talk. I would love to come back to the bar for a pre drink next time, may also try out the dimsum lunch."
1218,Tychoo72,Singapore,Singapore,29-September-2017,"Had lunch recently at la chine. Called to reserve and was impressed by the lady who offered if we wanted window seat when I did not request anything.

Arrived at the restaurant and the server led us to our table. Ordered some dimsum and a sea cucumber dish finishing with dessert. Food was ok and innovative, however was disappointed with the service.

The servers were not so attentive and lack the service standard of a fine dining restaurant. Worst was when we were done and walked out of the restaurant, no one show us out and when we were walking towards the lift lobby at the 6th floor, the lady at the counter did not even offer to press the lift for us or bother to acknowledge our presence. No service at all and made us felt unwelcome! Unless they are roadside stall, I will reckon they should have rendered the proper service a normal restaurant should have. Utterly disappointed at the service standard for such a nice restaurant."

I had dimsum, the in house dimsum was kinda impressive, I love how they serve us.
Might have a try on their dinner ala carte next time when I am there."

1222,dannyi827,Gold Coast,Australia,31-July-2017,"We had visited the Eiffel Tower in Paris and dined in the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Las Vegas so thought we should do the same in Macau. We had some difficulty locating the restaurant as we booked from our hotel and did not make note of the name and you need an escort to get to that level of the tower after finding the entrance to La Chine. That aside the food was magnificent and would highly recommend for a genuine Chinese experience with a French Twist. The duck with oranges was a standout as was the poached French oyster. This was part of the tasting platter that we chose for our lunch. The atmosphere is first class and fine dining at its best. Prices are not cheap but it is an experience well worth paying for. We highly recommend La Chine and will definitely return if we make it back to Macau"

Food was amazing. There are lots of varieties to choose from. All the food we ordered from its appetizer to dessert never disappoint! I love its seafood, really fresh. I find it interesting as I eat seafood almost everyday in my hometown.

Service are up and beyond. They deliver your wishes with smile. Each and everyone of them are very professional. Special mention to Chef Chung Kuy Fai who introduced each and every menu we ordered.

I'll definitely come back and I'll recommend La Chine to all my friends who will come to Macau."

The service was fine, the waitress making the tea in the traditional Chinese manner took her time to make sure all was perfect.
The food was excellent, considering the price it was a bargain to experience so many fine dishes that made up the tasting menu. Well done. Two thumbs up."
1232,Veronica L,None,None,20-April-2017,"Went there late late right before their last order. The staffs seemed a little disturbed, but remained friendly. We had the restaurant all to ourselves. The view wasn't that great as it is located on the 6th floor of the 'Eiffel tower'. Their atmosphere was chic and modern, and I thought it was rather romantic. Our waitress was very attentive. The food was amazing. The fried rice and the BBQ pork was one of the best I've had."

We ordered tea but the tea doesn't taste the   tea flavor  at all .Waste for the money 20 MOP per person!!!
The waiter served us right after the teaport is put on the table , but for people who drink tea normally we all know that you need to let the tea leave absorb the water and steep for awhile before you pour it into the glass...The first round of our tea is like water.... For the food, portion size is relatively small. If you have four people , you better order 6 dishes or more to satisfy your hunger. The beef rib is soft and tasty. The citrus flavour duck is delicious. The veggie is not that fresh. The waiters have good smile on their face, but most of them speak Chinese and with a strong accent. Don't think you are in the Eiffel tower to dine give you a nice view out there. Sorry it's a NO."

1238,Diam2Travel,Singapore,None,8-January-2017,"First visit was lunch. We had a window seat with a nice view of the surrounding hotels on the Cotai strip. They serve dim sum and ala carte dishes. The egg plant with minced pork & salted fish was perfect. We also enjoyed the black sesame ball with salted egg yolk.
We had dinner at the restaurant several days later. The night view shows the bright lights of the hotels in the area. Deserving mention is the honey bbq pork with the right amount lean and fat meat. Mapo tofu could be a little more spicy. The delicious spinach with Nepalese grain in broth was a winner! Overall great ambience, attentive service and affordable pricing. Keep it up."
1239,zoeyip,hk,None,3-October-2016,"We spotted this place on our way back to the hotel and suggested we might want to eat there later. After a busy afternoon, we gave no consideration to anywhere else and came straight here.
The food was great, amazing starters, main course was the Boston lobster braised with noodles in cheese sauce and it was a huge portion, just enough with a nice wine and a dessert to follow.
I noticed people leaving having had a lovely meal. and considering inside of the Eiffel tower, we've had a lovely view of the surroundings, and it's surely a pleasant experience, I would recommend to anyone i know about this restaurant. Also i have to say that Parisian Macau is such a nice place to stay, beautiful interior design, attentive staff, everything is just on point, i will definitely revisit this hotel and restaurant."

The restaurant wasn’t busy but it took them forever to bring our order. We got our first meal at 14-20 (our reservation was at 13-30). Then, we got the wrong dish. All tables around us were dirty and no one cleaned them during the entire time we were at the restaurant. Overall, the entire restaurant is dirty..food and napkins on the floor, surfaces are dirty.. felt like a cheap cha chaan teng.
5 star hotel price / 1 star service standard, never coming back again.
The entire place was so disorganized, no manager on the floor."

We have eaten at many Michelin restaurants and the anniversary meal he recommended was not only one of the finest meals we have ever eaten, and it was also very affordable. There were seven courses and each and every bite of the course offerings were perfectly cooked and prepared and were far superior to the Michelin restaurants where we have eaten and much less expensive. We were served courses of soup, vegetables, rice, lobster tail, desserts and other courses that were suprising large for the price and each and every morsel was flawlessly executed. Mr. Gong could not have been more helpful or attentive makiing our anniversary very special when he and his staff presented us with an anniversary cake. Our service was superb and I can't wait to go back to Le Chinois to eat and visit Kevin Gong and his staff. So much better than five stars."

Le Chinois was made all the more restful and welcoming by her all-big warm smiles. Assistant Manager Annie has been hosting us in the same hearty spirit for the last umpteen trips that we had visited Sofitel Macau. With her around, the already interesting Menu comes alive, choices made that much easier to decide on. All said, our innumerable meals at this remarkable restaurant would not have been so enjoyable and memorable had it not been for this fine lady, Le Annie. We appreciate you, dear Sofitel lady. Keep up the good work, as other customers are drawn in by this good referral. Indeed, Big Heart for a Good Fill, each and every time."

The experience was worth every penny!"
1255,Tablepourdeux,Dublin,Ireland,9-November-2018,"We ate here twice during our stay at Sofitel Macau. The first night was a lobster extravaganza, which might be overstating the meal a bit. We had a lovely salad with lobster to start, a great lobster soup and a half Boston lobster each, which was then strangely followed by a beef in black bean sauce (which was terrific), a pork dish, a tofu dish and a mountain of fried rice. All was good but a strange mix for a dinner advertised as a lobster extravaganza. Oh, and there was a divine dessert (see pic).

The following night we went back and ordered a la carte. We ordered two appetizers, two mains and rice. The waitress did advise us that we were ordering a lot of food for two! My partner's appetizer was a soup she really enjoyed and that was the first dish to arrive. When that was cleared away the mains came, and we were nearly finished the mains when my appetizer arrived. Maybe this is the way in China, but if something is billed as appetizer I expect it early in the meal - this is a Sofitel (French-based) hotel after all.

The only issue I had with my appetizer was my own fault. I had ordered chicken in a chilli sauce, but had forgotten that the chicken in China is often boiled and served on the bone. So eating cold chicken on the bone with wobbly skin with chop sticks is a bit of a challenge for me. What I had I enjoyed was great, but my chopstick skills prevented me from enjoying it as the chef had intended.

Overall we enjoyed our two nights dining here and would recommend it."
1256,t_dzai Y,None,None,3-September-2018,"Nice view. Beautiful setting. It was supposed to be a great dinning experience.

However, by the time we arrived, there are kids running around the restaurant. Even so, the waitress still seated us to the table next to the noisy kids family when there were plenty of empty tables. So our dinning experiece started with several kids played hide and seek even behind our chairs....

we asked the kids politely to go play somewhere else (at least not behind our chairs). No use. Their family not cared. And even the waitress not cared if we are bothered as well. at least they can offer us another table. it is truly lack of high professional training in a 5 star hotel restaurant;

We ordered Peking Duck, tasted pretty ok.

Peking soup, tooooo sour and sour only.

Sweet and sour pork, taste ok but not crispy enough.

Baby cabbage in broth, nice and delicate tasted.

Deep fried shrimp with cereal, pretty nice too."

The restaurant is located within the shops at the Parisian hotel.

We ordered the Sichuan Spicy soup with shrimp wontons (which we highly recommend), wagyu beef & chicken. In addition to that, we got noodles & vegetables to add to our hot pot. The portions were very large and might have been a bit much for two people. 1 kind of protein/ fish per person is a good rule to follow.

After ordering, we went up to a small bar cart, where they had about 15+ sauces that you can mix together to create your perfect dipping sauce for your meats & fish. This is great for seafood lovers & wagyu beef lovers. They also have a phenomenal selection of wine."

After another 20 minutes, still nothing so I asked to cancel my order and just asked for the bill leaving my rice untouched. Instead of bringing me the bill, 10 minutes later they finally bring the food, which i refuse to eat. They then tell me it's now free but after 45 mintues I no longer have an appetite and just want to leave. After I tell them I don't want it, they try to sell me a dessert and STILL DO NOT GIVE ME THE BILL. I again had to wait for that.

I stay frequently at the JW Futian and from the first I tried this place I lived it.
Start with the service, so English is not always spoken by all servers but they all try to make feel great.
The food is phenomenal! The mushroom soup was so amazing my friend and I didn’t want it to end. It came in a tea pot and the flavor was wonderful. The road duck came with a full carving station where the chef cut it in-front of us.
The fried noodles with beef are tasty and not to heavy.
Off course there is a good selection of tea.

But my favorite, the Lucky Bowl! Wow! What a pierce of art. An amazing dessert. It looks like a carrot but it is a kind of pastry with salt and sweet peanut filling. Y far one of my top 5 desserts.

Great place."

They never bother to replaced it and the steam fish was totally over cook and is hard ?!?

The stew pork was hard in the middle and cold in between !! We told them and they just smile and not even pay attention to reheat or replace it.

We did order the spicy chicken and they never even came !! They did not even replace the dirty plate and we saw only few table with customer. They were not happy too.

I have been to other Man Ho Restaurant but this one is the worst !!! The service is very bad. I will not recommended any of my friends coming here. As a platinum members of Marriott .... this need to be seriously look into ......."

Shrimp with cashews had just the right amount of heat to be spicy but not overpowering. Scallops on bean curd were cooked to perfection with well balanced taste profile gave the natural scallops flavour. Service was awesome - starter jelly fish was on a sesame oil was very tasty as well."

1349,790angelinaa,Singapore,Singapore,14-March-2017,"Reserved a table upon check in on 06/03/2017 through Lynn. With welcome and greeted my name and directed to a room.

We ordered Roasted Peking Duck 450MOP,the skin will to wrap with like a 'popiah skin' with slices of carrot,'honeydew','white carrot'. The skin is crispy but we find that is quite oily n 'fatty'. Another dish using the cut out duck meat and stirred fried with some 'veggie' and wrap with lettuce. This is not so oily.

Chye Sim with fresh Gingko nut and wolfberry 120MOP,the chye sim is 'sweet' as it is fresh.

Crispy noodle with Abalone 228MOP,the 'Yi Mee' fried until very crispy and an abalone is placed on top. The crispy noodle pour more sauce on it is very yummy. I like so much.

Spare Ribs in Strawberry Sauce 120MOP,is very tasty but we are so full so cannot finished. My friend mother requested to take away all the balance food. The lady helped us packed in containers n with disposable cutleries too.

While the waiting for the take away,I went to make payment. Never did I knew that they charged me for the wrong table which about 3,773MOP n i never realised and signed it. Till we wanted to leave then another woman came and stopped us said that I haven't make payment yet. She showed me our table no. and amount is not the same as I paid then, they realised they charged me wrongly. So they voided the 3,773MOP and recharge our correct amount 1,054MOP. I was too careless too never checked the amount before signing. But cannot understand they could make sure a big mistake to charge wrongly.

Rated average is because no matter food and service is feeling welcome,friendly and food are tasty too. Actually, if not wrongly charged,would rated excellent but I could not forgive this mistake as I am a tourist,if the next day,I leave Macau and then realised that I have being charged so much amount. I couldn't asked my money back. But well,because of this mistake,it make me more alert of the amount. And because they just passed me the credit card receipt not the receipt with which showed what we have ordered,thats why,I never realised whats went wrong. Usually in Singapore,they will upon payment an receipt will printed out to show and let u checked the dishes that you ordered before u make the payment but here don't have. And was I requested then was printed out for me."
1350,mee338,Atlanta,Georgia,3-March-2017,"Had a GREAT meal. Service by Richard was Excellent. Had 3 different dishes which were all really tasty and good. Kind of hi-end resturant because of location in Galaxy Mall and JW, but if you are a Marriott Rewards member, you get a really good discount which makes the value very good."

Only two of us, therefore we order 3 dishes and a bottle of white wine since eating seafood. We order one fish, pawn and a chicken. Both the fish and pawn were not fresh and poor quality but the chicken was ok. The environment and atmosphere were charming and glamorous,( the city view are fantastic) The services were very good, But the quality of food is the most important factor for a review of a restaurant, therefore I rate Man Ho Poor"

Duck meat was ok, just above average as I 've had better but with the noodles and broth as a dish in itself, it was really an average dish. Dim sum was also average and the quality of oolong tea could be much better for the price paid."

He was so attentive and knew exactly what we would enjoy eating. This would be very helpful if you have any allergy. We actually went back to have lunch again the following day.

There was a minor language issue so the Maitre D' allocated English speaking staff to look after us, and they did. We elected the 'as much as you can eat' option so that we could sample many dishes. Marco looked after this for us. We had a very enjoyable evening and dining experience. Certainly worth recommending.

The menu arrangement was NOT explained to us, we had to determine that for ourselves.
We ordered a couple of meals, and they were extremely average to say the least. The chicken was more bone than meat, the the pork was like chewing leather.
The serving size was small, the quality was poor, and the food itself lacked any real flavour. The prices are OK, I suppose, but really for the price, you expect more."

It was lovely. All the staff were so friendly, nice and attentive. A special shout out to Raymond who went above and beyond for us making sure we were comfortable and happy. I'm a vegetarian so I'm always slightly worry about what there is to eat but all my options were clearly marked on the menu, which made it much more easier and reassuring. Out of everything I ordered I have to say the noodles were my favourite, but that was a very hard choice as it was all so great.

The food is good. The price is reasonable. One of my friends from Hong Kong has been working in Macau for 7 years took us to this place for dinner. Some nights the owners will sing to entertain the customers.

And the oldest and Portuguese egg tart shop also near to this restaurant. This restaurant is beside a church and is not easy to find out by visitors. We first time to go there by taxi. Need to arrive center of Coloanr and go along with seacoast.
This Portugal restaurant looks like food stall and a little bit old. But their food will attract you over and over again when you first to eat. But it is a little bit expensive. Chicken a la Portuguese, shrimp Portuguese, Portuguese Crispy suckling pig they make is so so so so excellent and impression. …. Portuguese food in Macau is consist of portuguese food , India food and Malaysia and Chinese food culture. It is more suitable taste for many visitor. They also make good Chinese food and other western food. The environment around that restaurant is so leisure and relaxing. I enjoy wind from sea coz it just face to sea. The boss of restaurant also is passionate to clients."

Prices are ok, but is silly to pay charge for service (plates..) so be aware. Also staff are nit good in english but somehow all turns out ok. Probably they will be very busy so relax if they are a bit slow."
1736,HelenaGuerra,Washington DC,District of Columbia,26-January-2016,"Where to begin? The food was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get. People barely speak anything but Chinese and then charge 10% service charge? Are you serious? It was freezing cold inside and they allow people to smoke which is disgusting. Nothing really positive to say, heard great things about the food, maybe we ordered the wrong dishes..."

1739,Saesario_Indrawan,Semarang,Indonesia,16-December-2015,"I visited Café Nga Tim on a slow day in December 2015. The service was good and efficient. The waitress immediately gave us menu in English upon seeing that we are foreign people.

The Portuguese Chicken and The Yang Chow fried rice were fantastic. Portuguese chicken was curry-like dishes with cheese sprinkled on top and baked in an oven. As for the Yang Chow Fried Rice, the shrimps were fresh as you can taste a hint of sweetness in them. The seasoning was just in perfect balance. None of the ingredients was overwhelming.

For the dessert, we ordered serradura which in my opinion was marvelous. This semifreddo dessert is made of sweetened cream with fine breadcrumb topping resembles sawdust. Hence the name serradura, meaning sawdust. It was one of the best dessert that I had during our stay in Macau.

The portions are quite large for Asians tummy and one portion of dish is enough for two people. Therefore it really is worth the price."
1740,borysb9,Kiev,Ukraine,19-November-2015,"Renowned for location and signature macanese dishes, Nga Tim is maybe the best restaurant/cafe in Coloane village. My most favourite dish is their 'sauna prawns'. They soak live prawns in wine (if you are too sensitive ask them to do this not on your table, as it is standard in order to show you that prawns are alive). Then by putting the prawns on preheated stones they are steamed in wine. Delicious.
Not on budget side. Sangria is OK but more expensive than average."
1741,kianac2015,Chiyoda,Japan,3-October-2015,"This little gem of a place is located in Coloane Village. You can walk past the fruit shops and head down the alley and you come to a gorgeous yellow and light blue Portuguese church and to your right (if facing away from church) is Nga tims. The staff speak little english, but are always super helpful and nice.
The food is great, the place looks a little shabby, but thats what you get. I generally judge a place by food and service, especially in this part of the world.

So if you are looking for a nice chinese/portoguese/ seafood type of place, this is a winner."
1742,Helder_Fernandes,Porto,Portugal,3-October-2015,"Simple restaurant, definitely not posh at all. Located in the Colocane village, under some arcades, offers a peaceful atmosphere to talk and enjoy the food on the company of friends or family.
The food is a wide selection of oriental and western dishes, meat and fish, I believe there's options to every taste.
The staff talks limited english, and are not very fast, but this is the place to a relax meal, so no rush at all!"
1743,ajworld85,San Francisco,California,10-September-2015,"First, you should know that this is on the far other side of the island. If you take the bus, it will not be an easy journey. But if you want a taste of the real Macau, and one that's far away from the mega casino resorts, this place is for you. There's a broad selection of some Macanese and Portuguese favorites, and it's all under a magnificent setting (preferably nighttime) of being in a church square. I remember being brought here a long time ago by a friend of a friend, and I was so enthralled by that experience that I was keen to replicate it on this trip.

Savor the last few breaths of a fast-disappearing colonial Macau. The food good but not great, and it won't come cheap, but if you're into local charm, you won't go wrong with a late dinner here."

1745,chansaikeong,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,15-July-2015,"This is a local restaurant that not too far away from Lord Stow’s Bakery. It is just opposite the St. Francis Xavier Church.

I was having a brunch (at about 11.30am) in this restaurant while visiting Coloane. Not much that we ordered because of the egg tarts that we ate at our first stop.

I can only rate the services and the foods here were average. The prices were expensive too.

My comments after trying the foods:
1. Yee mee – Too dry and tasteless.
2. Sausage – Too salty.
3. Baked cheese seafood rice in pineapple – Not bad, can give a try.

Remember that the portion of the foods here is a bit big size. Order less first, if it is not enough then only order again."

1747,kasuganomichi,Kyoto,Japan,14-June-2015,"This venue is situation/environment restaurant. Small but famous church, public garden in front of the church, tables under eaves, and view looking over the sea and the mainland.

Our purpose to go to Coloane village was to buy egg tarts at Lord Stow's Bakery. Then we strolled around and found this restaurant by accident.

That day, service was a little bit slow mainly because some of the staff had a party with regular guests right next to our table. But no big damage. We found our favorite Vinho Verde (Portuguese green wine with mild bubble) Casal Garcia on the shelf at the counter (there seems no written wine list here). A bottle came immediately, nicely chilled. We selected 西洋白酒蜆煲 Wine-steamed Clams in casserole, and 焗咖哩蝦飯 Baked shrimp curry rice. Both match light flavor of Garcia.

They proclaim their strength lies in combination of Western and Chinese cooking on the menu, the signs, and tissue packets, so maybe next time we will try that, like Roast pigeon and Suckling baby pig.

Atmosphere was very special, and at dinner time it would be more romantic."
1748,ballw2014,None,None,28-May-2015,"Great Macanese cusine, combined with Portuguese and local Chinese food. Cafe Nga Tim has good and calm surrounding. The fried shrimp is great. African chicken is also good. Moreover, the price is not expensive. I recommended this restaurant."
1749,Wirakarn S,None,None,12-April-2015,"My sister chose this place and I had no idea that they serve such great food! We had to order twice the deep fried pork ribs. It was that good! Every dish got our nod of approval except the baked rice in pineapple. Maybe it's good and we're just not used to the taste."
1750,Sunny_monkey_2,Thailand,None,12-April-2015,"It was not bad 8, 10 years ago, at that moment food was good, price was reasonable and of good service. I went there quite often.
Perhaps the Chapel next to it is getting famous (appeared in quite some movies) or it is overrated by tourists, it is no longer good now. They lost enthusiasm in maintaining quality but price keeps going up.

Not necessary to go there purposely other than have a casual meal when you pass~by by chance."
1751,David R,Ho Chi Minh City,Vietnam,27-March-2015,"Great Food,Good Atmosphere, Attentive and Caring staff. And yes I met the very happy Mr Nga Tim, Very good value for money. A must stop and eat place in Coloane Macau.Very local experience amongst many other small cafes. Taken there by local friends.The sizzling lamb is a must as well as the BBQ pork nuckles and seafood soup. Delicious. Mr Nga Tim also has a sister restaurant Chan Chi Mei, more formal just nearby.Going again next week."
1752,danmcg90,Pontyclun,United Kingdom,21-March-2015,"I visited NGA Tim after doing some value for money grocery shopping in Coloane and was pleasantly surprised! The menu was superb and great value for money. There were even fresh fish in a tank for those who enjoy their seafood! I had the pork chill with rice and for only 60 MOP it was flavoursome and came as a big portion! My friend had the Portuguese rice which was also fantastic! I would also recommend the coconut to drink, for only 35 mop you are served a fresh coconut with a straw and a spoon, a drink and desert all in one!"

After dinner take a walk around the corner and have a freshly baked Portuguese tart from Lord Stow’s Bakery. YUM!!"
1759,Intrepidtraveller333,Melbourne,Australia,15-July-2014,"Always enjoy this delightful local restaurant in the square with St Francis Church as a backdrop.
It's not swish or fancy and there is little English, but go there to experience true local food which is absolutely fresh - even the sangria fruit is hand cut which is why it take a while to come to you!
Stand out dishes a plenty so take the taxi and give it a shot. Really, really good value too."
1760,spesbona,Cape Town Central,South Africa,20-May-2014,"I love the tranquility of Coloane and have been to this place before (perhaps more than once) but that was many years ago and, although I do not recall anything great about the food, I loved the romantic location and rustic ambience. We arrived about 8pm and, even though it was Tuesday, almost every table was taken and we were led to one at the far end out of sight, behind a pillar, and right next to a grotty area where a woman was cleaning fish or whatever. Then they just forgot about us, and if there was another half-decent restaurant in the village we would definitely have left at this point. After about 10 minutes I saw an empty table in the centre of the buzzing action and we moved there, but I got the impression they would have continued to ignore us unless I  expedited  matters by abruptly stopping a waitress as she went past us as if we were invisible. None of the staff - at least those we dealt with - seem to speak even a word of English which made things difficult as they seem to have 3 menus and, even though the dishes are  translated  into English there are questions - especially as a lot of the items sound very strange to the un-initiated. Eventually we played safe and chose the  espedata  mixed grill which was OK, just. In short, this place is very over-rated and they are living on their unique position and long standing, but certainly not quality. And I hate having to pay a 10%  service charge  when given bad service.....grrrrrr"
1761,Haelist,None,None,5-April-2014,"It's in a comparative remote part of Macau, 15 minutes taxi from major hotels in taipa and 45 minutes from Macau peninsula but worth a trial.

A very local Portuguese restaurant but don't expect anything fancy. Try get an outdoor table to feel the local Macau dining style. Must try the liquor drunk shrimps cooked in its own style!"
1762,Pushworth,Singapore,None,23-March-2014,"The food: Drunken Prawns, BBQ Eel, BBQ Suckling pig, Portuguese Chicken, Fried rice, Fried Calamari, and lots of Sangria... bill came to about $300HKD per person (12 people) ... overall verdict it was great. The food looks mouth watering, and is mighty tasty. Highly recommend visiting. Suggest booking in advance as it was fully booked when we got there. We were a stag/bachelor party, and we were welcomed. Service could be slow at some points, but otherwise okay. Many locals dining there, so that's a definite good sign. Nice alternative to Fernando's, and easier to get to."
1763,tombillinge,Trumbull,Connecticut,8-March-2014,"We visited Nga Tim on a rainy day in Coloane and got food that lifted our mood, but not into elation.

The outdoor tables in the cloisters is quite atmospheric and you certainly feel like you are somewhere different. The service was genuine and we were seated and given a pot of tea to warm our bones. We ordered some chourico, gallina a africana and some grilled sardines.

The chourico came first and was delicious, but over-grilled and dry. The next item was the pair of plump little sardines. We asked for more lemon and then dowsed the fish with the juice. They were simple, but excellent. Cooked perfectly and very fresh, we were very happy.

The chicken came out last and it really wasn't too special. It didn't have coconut milk and it was a bit flat. The chicken was chopped in a way that left lots of sharp bone shards to pick around. It was not the best African chicken we have had and we would recommend that dish from this restaurant.

Basically, we had one good dish and two sub-par ones. All in all, we had an OK lunch, but will not be returning if we visit Coloane in the future."
1764,Saclin,None,None,13-December-2013,"Nga Tim is a great place to while away an afternoon in Macau. Sitting outside with a cold beer and a plate of seafood is highly recommended."

1767,Just_my_views,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,26-September-2013,"Staff are not friendly ( but then this seems to be so everywhere in Macau!) but not impolite. The boss ( a Chinese gentleman) though, seems a most amiable guy. Food is more like home style cooking. One of the dishes we ordered was the Baked chicken. We sort of expected it to be crispy skin but it turned out to be with a lot of gravy - somewhat like unspicy curry, which wasn't too bad. We then asked for some bread to go with it it took a while for them to deliver the bread but when it came it was piping hot like it was freshly baked and so very good! If you go all the way to Coloane to try Lord Stow's tarts, might as well try this place as well. Just do not expect fine dining . Seating inside is air conditioned if you don't fancy alfresco"
1768,SmasKim,Macao,None,10-June-2013,"I love the location, the atmosphere but I’m not a big fan of the food.
The place is great when weather is not extremely hot or cold, because one can seat outside and look at the beautiful church and kids can play in the church square and we can keep an eye on them.
This is not a fancy place, it is very simple and staff is always busy and do not understand English, but the menu has English. Like somebody said, cups and plates are plastic and the napkins are a paper toilet roll for self service.
There are different kinds of food. We usually eat the beef noodles in the iron plate, boiled shrimps (we ask to add ice), broccoli with scallops, “pak fan yu”, a small fried fish that my son calls French fries fish and the fried squids (jiu yim yao yu). They also have Portuguese and Chinese dishes that sometimes we try, but the previous ones are our favorites. It is a place to go to relax, don’t stress, because sometimes food takes some time to arrive.
I take some friends from Portugal there and they all like it."
1769,GerardWW,Singapore,Singapore,30-January-2013,"Don't come for the service, the setting (although the outdoor seating by the church is quite nice) or a fine-dining experience, this is all about the food....no airs and graces here, just rough 'n' ready, plastic tables, plastic napkins, plastic chairs, plates and cutlery/chopsticks but damn good food, and probably the best really authentic Macanese food place in Macau. Probably why its always filled with mainland tourists and locals. You'll have to shout out for service and be ready to wait and have patience or you'll quickly get frustrated. The staff seem like they speak no English or just cant be bothered to be helpful, but just be loud and fearless and you'll get what you want eventually."
1770,LaiLaiLing,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,30-January-2013,"Alfresco dining at its best at Macau. If you go there early ie 12pm then you will get best service and attention unlike during peak hours which is normally starts around 1pm. Clam and mussles with black beans sources are the best. Curry crab and roast pig very good too. Sauna prawn and grilled Sardine fish are tasty also. Bread here is a must cos it is so soft insides unlike some others. Good place to relax, have a good meals and at the same time enjoy the sights and sounds."
1771,kevhkHongKong,None,None,6-December-2012,"Fantastic selection of Macanese, Chinese and Portuguese food with great value wines. Very local feel but lovely to sit outside and savour the food. Best dishes were tripe and chick peas in a Portuguese sauce and drunken shrimp although it was all good"

First order came fast  Sauna Prawns  very good, after that nothing arrived. Asked about our order again and again, given the cold shoulder. Got fed up after an hour asked for the bill, asked for the bill again, ignored again. Went to the cashier and was charged for the food that never came, only paid for the prawns. Staff were rude, so was I, I guess we were even. Went to McDonalds had a good meal, will never go back again."

The cafe is located on the left side of the Church of St. Francis Xavier. After the mandatory (yes, mandatory -- you just have to try them!) visit to Lord Stow's for your Portuguese egg tarts, there's a 10-minute walk until you reach Nga Tim.

It is so relaxed, especially for weekend lunches with friends and a few bottles of vinho verde. The food is good but not pretentious, nor expensive. The sardines are especially good. The service isn't super friendly, but they are often very busy, so I don't mind if they don't take time to chat, the staff move fast. They don't all speak English but the ample menu is in English, Chinese and Portuguese so it's not hard to communicate your order."

1784,PaigeAdams,Sydney,Australia,3-November-2019,"Went here for dinner with a few friends - the food was very good quality and you can watch the noodles get made if you sit near the centre of the restaurant. Large restaurant with plenty of space, air conditioned and easy to get to. The wine list was a bit disappointing - there was a very limited selection."
1785,SnowballAdventure,Barnet,United Kingdom,21-June-2019,"North (The Venetian) is actually a food court inside the Venetian hotel and is located at its St. Mark's Square. Comparing to the peaceful St. Mark's Square at the Vegas' Venetian hotel, this one in Macau is totally overshadowed by its food court. It's actually hard to tell this square was originally built as a modified Venice's St. Marks Square. As inside this Square, the ground floor is completely filled with tables and chairs and noises, only if you look up, then you would spot the modified but aesthetically designed, Venetian Gothic architecture of windows and balconies on each side of the square. Don't forget to acknowledge the beautiful Venetian lampposts and the artificial skyline ceiling as well. Unfortunately, this Square cannot serve its original purpose as I didn't think the architect designed the square to be used as a food court.

Re: Food:
We went here for lunch after checked in at the Venetian hotel. We brought 14 dim sums, 2 soy milks and 2 cokes from  Tim Ho Wan  and  Ocean Empire Congee  kiosks. In general, the dim sums from Tim Ho Wan were not bad. Although they weren't as good as their sibling branches in HK, but the foods still very tasty. i.e. the BBQ Pork Bun was crumby outside & the pork inside was not oversweet, the Steamed Rice Rolls (i.e. Shrimps & Roasted Pork) were light and refreshing, the shrimps inside the Shrimps Dumplings were sweet and crunchy...etc. Overall, the food quality was good and it's definitely above the average food court's standard. However, I came back in the evening and went to  Toei Delights  to order a Japanese  Deep Fried Pork Cutlet Udon meal . It was very disappointing, the deep fried pork cutlet was too thin and was overcooked as it was dry and chewy. The udon soup was also too salty and was over-powdered.

Re: Price:
Our lunch cost more than HKD $800 and my solo dinner (with a coke) cost $115. Everything was overpriced inside the food court. For example, the food price at Tim Ho Wan kiosk was 3-4 times more expensive than its branches in HK. We spent over HKD $1,100 on this food court alone which was a bit ridiculous.

Overall, even though I thought the food was not bad (from Tim Ho Wan & Ocean Empire) and we were spoiled for choices at this food court, I still didn't like this foodcourt. It's because of its location as I preferred to keep the St Mark's Square free for cafe or Western restaurants and the foods were absurdly overpriced for foodcourt's standard. Nevertheless, this foodcourt obviously would still be the best lunch/ snack/ dinner options if you wanted to go somewhere close while you stayed at the Venetian hotel/ casino."

All the staff were really friendly and polite, and I enjoyed being able to watch the talented chefs making the buns and noodles fresh in the center kitchen!
For dessert we had the Ginger Crème Brûlée, which was delicious and they light the sugar in front of you so thats really fun!

This restaurant is clearly unique to this hotel in Macau and easily accommodated my family and young grandson. The staff were very helpful and attentive and the food was timely in arrival and very tasty, if a little spicy. If you do not like spicy then be sure to ask as very seems to be the standard.
The prices are reasonable except fir the beer but the food is the main reason for going and this is worth a visit."

The North however, is unique. The food was exquisite, service impeccable and as we sat at the bar the show put on inadvertently by the noodle chefs highly entertaining.
The go to dish is the caramelised eggplant. The vegetable dumplings were also sublime."

They offer the same menu. The food was so good that we went to both outlets. Most impressive were the pork and cucumber strips dipped in an amazing sauce; the fried bananas with crunchy toffee topping dipped in ice-water; and the crispy duck. Bowls of noodles were also excellent -- big enough to share if you also have side dishes. We tried 7 restaurants in Cotai -- the North Restaurant was the best."

1810,soshbfly,Scotland,United Kingdom,15-July-2018,"We visited North as were staying in the Venetian. The restaurant decor is relaxed and casual but in a stylish way (not down market in the slightest!)

As we did throughout whole trip, we ordered dim sum to start and then main courses. The waitress seemed surprised when we also ordered main courses and we realised when our meal was served - the portions were huge!

My husband and I both love spicy food but my seafood broth was nearly the spiciest thing I had in a long while (see picture with all the red chilli's and you'll see why!)

Service was good and the food up to a high standard. They also had a decent wine list that didn't seem out of the world expensive.

I'd easily visit again if visiting Macau."

Great place but limited for night life. We found one amazing bar at the st Regis across the road. Very stylish and funky.
Macau is a must see even if only for a few days.
The hotel itself is amazing. Huge and extravagant. Attached to other hotels so you can simply walk from casino to casino. Lots of shopping very high end and of course the gondolas inside.
Treat your self!"

Everything in the room, furnishing, space, view was grand. The amenities were good. There was an arcade, a Swimming pool, a gym all at a secluded location so strictly for guests only.
Gondolas makes it ‘Italian’ Venice lookalike but with in aircon space and sky ceiling too.
Of course the casino was convenient and new and food was easily available.
The shuttle service was very good and brought us to places we needed to visit.
Food court, restaurants, shopping were all right there.

Good experience to stay here. Yes, I would recommend this place."

All of them came out together with a million pieces of chilli in them but the broth or sauce was a tad oily and not that spicy. We felt as though they tried to enhance the spice just with chilli only but the standout fish was the beef fillet for us though the chicken and peanuts was a little dry but ok while the spicy fish broth was anything but. Very oily and the fish could not be identified other than the staff calling it “mandarin fish”. It was a flat fish with small bones in it and inedible. A bit disappointing overall but the decor was nice and quick service. I’d go again but order other dishes."

Unlike the other crowded places at the Venetian, the North was a place of tranquility and we could enjoy a very good dinner.
The North offers authentic northern Chinese cuisine in a modern but warm ambience.

Service was good. The only thing I would criticize was that sometimes it was difficult to call a waiter as they didn’t seem to pay too much attention.

The food however was very good. I don’t remember the names of our dishes as it was last October when we’ve been there, but as cold dish I would especially recommend the poached pork belly with cucumber, leeks and garlic sauce.
Their selection of wines seem to be very good and we could see e.g. bottles of Château Pétrus as we were sitting next to the walk-in wine cabinet. If you like beer, taste the Macau beer."

1848,Anna911,Washington DC,None,11-April-2017,"Hands down some of the best Chinese food that I had in Macao. Also one of the nicest dining experiences. Despite being adjacent to the casinos it is not loud, you can see into the kitchen from many of the dining table so you have a nice show. Service was spot on. As others have stated the Kongpo style chicken with cashews was a personal favorite, although it could have used some rice."
1849,travelbug0082,Singapore,Singapore,29-March-2017,"The dishes here are all interesting and tasty. The staff is also very attentive and patient. They recommended some very amazing dishes and all of us enjoyed our dinner very much. They have a noodle bar in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch the chef making the noodle."

1851,92brentm,Orange,California,20-March-2017,"I was here for a conference, and was left on my own for one night. After surveying all restaurants in the hotel, I chose North.. GREAT choice!

I ordered beef w/ noodles, the lamb and curry with buns, and Xiao long bao.

First of all - let me say that I was a bit hesitant to order the beef w/ noodles, because while it usually looks good, many times I find it to lack a lot of flavor. This bowl certainly set the bar for how GREAT it can be!! I was hooked.

I then got what usually is pork buns, but they substituted lamb with a lot of onions - which then had a little curry sauce on the side. This was an absolutely fantastic dish.

The Xiao long bao was a big disappointment.. LARGE balls of meat inside, with doughy texture and very little flavor. nowhere close to the quality, flavor, and freshness of say Din Tai Fung."
1852,pippenjc,Taipei,Taiwan,19-March-2017,"It never gets old. I always enjoyed walking around. If you want to take a nice pic with not so many people, go in the morning or late at night; or else, it is always packed with visitors and hard to take a picture. You can buy an ice cream at Godiva or a Coffee and enjoy a good time and walking around."

1857,Gayatri K,Karnataka,India,11-February-2017,"We went for dinner because they had Kung Pao chicken in their menu. We did not have reservations but seems like a wise thing to reserve early. The place was large with a nice open kitchen. The service was also good. They were flexible and understood our requirements. They made us a fried rice with egg and spring onion and this was nowhere in the menu. The kong po chicken (as they called it) was excellent and we were glad we came here for that. They had a fried chicken ( northern china style) which had sichuan pepper and plenty of roasted red chillies and great fried chicken. Somebody who likes spicy food (th type who uses Sriracha in almost every meal in their US homes) would love it. The price was reasonable for a nice sit down restaurant. The staff was able to converse fairly well with us in English.
Definitely worth a revisit"

There are many shops, food court, and also the most famous thing in Macau, the casino. The ceiling is decorated as the sky. Many types of goods and services are provided in the shopping mall. When you are tired, you can go to the food court around the shopping mall and have a chinese tea or any other drink."
1863,HarshitDravid,None,None,6-December-2016,"Stay at The Venetian' Macau is worth every buck. The place redefines Luxury and leaves you confused whether to spend your entire time inside this architectural marvel or venture out in the town. The rooms are elegant to say the least and a walk inside the hotel is a joyride, taking you through the streets and alleys of Venice.
The food for Indian travellers though (preferring Vegetarian food) could be a challenge as there are few options available.

Overall a great experience!!"

There are shopping mall, food court, and also the most famous thing in Macau, the casino, but this is another story. By the way, go back to the shopping mall and food court, the ceiling is decorated as the sky, so you would more free during shopping in the building. Many types of goods and services are provided in the shopping mall, as Macau is a globalized city, there are also goods coming from all over the world. When you are tired, you can go to the food court around the shopping mall and have a tea. After relaxing, you can then continue with you shopping trip. A personal recommendation is the Portuguese-style egg tarts of Lord Stow's Bakery, this is a delicacy which must try in Macau."

To the Venetian, we have seen a lot of people in the queue, it seems that their fans really good enthusiasm. Opening, the venue is screaming, we are looking forward to their appearance. Everyone was crazy that day. And good friends chasing star feel good. After the concert we went to a local store, eat supper, the happy end of today's trip."

I recommend this place for people who likes to chill and also for the couples as it gives out this really romantic vibe. We rode the Gondola and it was really good.

I have tried other hotels across venetian like Galaxy which is more expensive which I never enjoyed because their staff cannot express themselves well and majority are Chinese staff who talks to their customers   as if I owe her/him !!! The people of venetian are more hospitable and friendly. Rooms are very clean and big. I feel very happy whenever I stay in the Venetian Hotel for vacation . Im planning to go back this year again ."

1888,ChrisGray,The Hague,The Netherlands,5-May-2016,"I visited this place with my wife and friends and mostly it was good. I have the feeling that once we had found the dishes suiting our tastes more then I would enjoy it more. I know this sounds obvious but the menu is extensive and much on it is quite unfamiliar to me so a good deal of guessing was done regarding what the food would be like. There was nothing that we had that was outstanding but some tasty dishes such as the fried pork and chicken with potatoes and fresh noodles. I would come back again for a quick light lunch or dinner as the price was reasonable but I would not come back here for a special occasion or a long dinner with friends as there are better options."

1890,HB511318,Macao,Portugal,21-April-2016,"The Venetian is a big shopping mall, it offers world class dining, shopping and entertainment and luxurious suite rooms all under one big roof. Big may be an understatement. There is definitely something for everyone regardless of the young or the old, that’s why Venetian Macao Resort Hotel has become one of the must-visit tourist attractions in Macau. The Venetian also hold on many world renowned concerts and exhibitions such as The Titanic Exhibition, Human Bodies exhibition and Korean group concert. There are many mid-range shops in The Venetian, as well as a food court that offers an international selection of cuisine. While the food there may not be wholly authentic or very delicious, it is definitely decent enough to whet your appetite. You can try best eggs tarts in Macau from Lord Stow’s bakery. The Venetian also provides a picturesque background for taking pictures or simply breathtaking viewing pleasure, especially in the night when it is alight with colourful lights and decorations. The Venetian is a place to shopping, gambling. And also feeling the Las Vegas. There are different price level’s goods in it and it free to everyone’s come in. Macao is too small area. I cannot find too much shopping mall in it. I think it is a nice place to shopping and relax in my weekend."
1891,SupattraPi,Bangkok,Thailand,21-April-2016,"We looked at the review and decided to try The North and we did not disappoint at all. Restaurant atmosphere is very nice and cozy.

There's always one staff stand close to our table and quickly attend to us before I even ask her to come. All the food we ordered are nice. Just be mindful, there's one spice which is their authentic Sichuan cuisine, it's kind of like pepper but when you bite, it taste a bit spicy and has specific aroma in your mouth. Try the fresh salad, the wanton and chicken kungpao. Clear vegetable and tofu soup is also very nice. We had nice experience there."

1898,amandam815,Glasgow,United Kingdom,11-March-2016,"Visited here on 9th March for dinner and had a very enjoyable meal. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and spacious. It was quite quiet when we visited.

We had the crispy pork with rice and slow cooked beef with rice along with vegetable dumplings and a glass of wine and beer. The total cost was £40 which was reasonable given the quality of food. Only negative, we didn't finish the dumplings as found these to be quite bland compared with others we had during our trip to Hong Kong and Macau."

Great decor with a show kitchen in the middle, where cooks performed gymnastics with noodles . We had several types of dumplings, a wonderful cold okra salad, a fish chilli stew and two types of noodles with meat and soup. Everything was fresh hot and served with alacrity and charm by the mainland waitresses.
A good lunch for just over £50 for 3 of us. Will come again."

Child friendly and the wait staff attentive.

As said the crispy duck was great.
This is now on the frequent visit list"
1903,Seaton1975,Vancouver,Canada,2-February-2016,"I have eaten here a few times. It is awesome mainland Chinese food. Great regional dishes from the North and some favorites from Sichuan. Great noodle soup. Go traditional ox tail noodle soup. The dumplings in spicy sauce were a hit at our table. They also have my favorite Ma Po Tofu. They nailed the Pork belly. Definitely try. They are making all the noodles on spot. Fresh with good atmosphere."

The ambience is great,the waitress are good,not too expensive either,better than you eat in food court.. Non smoking restaurant here,I don't see any western people here,all Asian.. And this restaurant's signature is noodle,the noodle is so yummy but it's nothing my 2.7 years old baby can eat here"

1910,sunnyozzies,None,None,14-November-2015,"Firstly i would like to say my husband and i were made to feel so welcomed. The crowds were huge but there was so much staff so everyone was given the very same royal treatment.
We had a very grand suite and it was absolutely spotless! And if i could've fit the bed in my suitcase i would've.
There is so much to do in Macau other than shopping and trying your luck but if you are a bit of a shopper and like a punt this is absolutely the place for you. Little (big) VEGAS! It certainty kept entertained the whole time.
I think when we visit again we might try a cooler time of year because its was the warmest weather i have ever been in, however everywhere is aircondiotioned and the heat didn't really stop us from getting out and exploring.
I would definitly make the suggestion to go and see the saint Pauls ruins and do the signed walk through the old town, had a very strong Portuguese feel to the place and we loved it!

Dont forget to try the little egg custards and even though they dont look totally appealing the compressed meats that nearly every market stall sell taste better than they look...

The Venetian Macau we shall meet again!"

North is our (my friends, colleagues, husbands) favourite cheap place to eat. You really need a group of friends to go here, as it is a bit pricey if its just two people, plus you want to try most of the stuff on the menu and you just cant with two people, too much food.
The staff are always accommodating and friendly, even with the little english they know.
Definitely a must place to eat when you are in Macau next."

Recommend the Shui Ju Yu, Woodear mushrooms, Hao Shui Gai (mouthwatering chicken) Suan La Tang ( hot and sour soup).
Not as spicy as some Sichuan but well balanced ."

The waitress was rude in entertaining our queries on food as we may not be that eloquent in communicating with her language. She was just so in a hurry to get our orders, thus, we relied on the select pictures we saw on the menu and on the brief description on some. While it was just normal to refill initially consumed tea pots with another round of hot water, she hesitated saying we need to order another fresh pot! On our second visit, the service was adversely different as the girl who got our orders was too pleasant and eager to explain to us our desired order. We enjoyed much and was lucky to have been seated despite full house. Food was expectedly great specially the hand pulled cold beef noodles, xiao ling baos, dumplings and crispy pork with black vinegar. Price was very reasonable."

The food was very good, hot and sour soup, marinated spinach, lamb with chilli and cumin, eggplant salad.
What was very unexpected was the price. Very affordable indeed, still at a level it doesn't constitute a special dinning occasion, i see myself going there often.
Also, the staff were very insistent on giving us a better table. And the place itself is very inviting, large, with a sort of a communal feeling. The counter surrounding the noodle station looks great (nice wood, large, generous, earthy) and i am soon going there to seat at the counter and try great looking noodles.
Near the entrance there's another area with a rather enticing wooden counter"

1932,djmciver2003,Sydney,Australia,18-March-2015,"If you want great food I would suggest North. It makes a great chilli chicken main and very tasty dumplings. You can also sit and see them make fresh spaghetti and pasta in the centre of the restaurant right in front of you. Interesting to watch."
1933,itaewon-mickey,Seoul,South Korea,1-March-2015,"Noodles here are great. Choice of type of noodles, toppings, soup base gives you an opportunity to sample their cuisine. A little spicy, but very good.

Only complaint here is its service. Not sure if the problem is understanding English, but almost always have problems with no delivering all dishes that were ordered.

Once you check, dishes are delivered in a reasonable time."
1934,Madeleine J,Brisbane,Australia,28-February-2015,"My family and i dined here and enjoyed it. The 'multigrain fried rice' was delicious and the dumplings were also very nice. The atmosphere is wonderful. It is a very nice place for families and is one of the best chinese restaurants in macao, in my opinion. The staff were lovely and all so attentive. We had a very lovely experience and will definitely be returning. A must try for visitors of macao"
1935,NomSutipolC,Bangkok,Thailand,15-February-2015,"Walked by North and thought that I would give this place try. A nice looking place with an open/show kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.

Ordered a Harbin beer, Xio Long Bao and pork dumplings for lunch. Total bill was MOP 178.00 with Sands discount card.

Food arrived fairly prompty. Portion size were generous and tasted pretty good.

Service was however somewhat below average. The free wifi also didn't work.

Plus point is you could watch the chefs in action making noodles etc. in the open kitchen. Interesting and quite to watch. Although I observed that that they didn't seem too concern with cleaning their hands between activities."

It's give us an atmosphere that we are in China - apart from you just walked into Venice a minute ago. Love the restaurant design. They also have a live station, which they made homemade noodle.

The food is super nice. We are not Chinese, so we try something like local chinese - they serve in a dish like a hanger where you have a meet with vegetable and then dip it in the sauce - don't know what is the name of the dish because our Chinese friends ordered it for us. Then we have this fried shrimp with sauce which is super delicious. Also, the vegetable - thought it was eggplant? a very nice dish as well.

The price is quite high though for a meal, but truly worth it! Love the dishes and the service is super awesome :))) can't remember the lady's name - but really, you did a great job!

Will be there again if I have a chance to be back in Venetian Macau!"

We did not have a reservation, the place is quite busy but we were still seated quickly.

We were able to place our order fairly quickly and the dishes came in reasonable time.
However, they give you this 6oz size tea cup, and they don't refill it without asking.
I had to flag down a staff member every time, which is unusual when compared to other restaurants I have eaten at in Macao, at this price point.

The food is well cooked, well presented and the portion is great. We ordered thinly sliced garlic pork with cucumber slices, northern style lamb pancakes and a hot and sour soup."
1959,Thegourmand76,Bressuire,France,5-June-2018,"We have been there many times and the service is always great, simple, close and modest.
We had always good food and we found it better than Venetian North, maybe because of Carry the manager that always look after you ?
Boty are good to be honnest just not goimg there too often.

Thumps up, and see you soon."

Serve nice Xiao long bao, they had got a couple of famous must try dishes on the first few pages of Their menu.

But why only four stars, well don’t e peck too much of a service, I spend 15 mins waiting at the main entrance without anyone serving or noticing me. Once you are seat they don’t even offered you anything unless you ask for it. So if you are looking for service then please don’t expect too much."
1964,liucy752,None,None,24-May-2017,"The restaurant provides Northeastern Chinese cuisine, Beijing cuisine and Sichuan cuisine. The food is delicious, service is good, and most importantly, the price is reasonable. Highly recommended."
1965,RBM21,Singapore,Singapore,10-February-2017,"The place is not so crowded which I liked so it's cozy and not noisy. Food was great and most of all - the chili oil was perfect. We love spicy food, and adding this oil to our dishes had complimented the food well and did.not kill the flavours of.the dishes served."
1966,Diana9228,Surfers Paradise,Australia,5-January-2017,"The food was fantastic - there were a group of 4 sharing plates and each dish was sensational. There was also the attraction of seeing the noodles being freshly made. I'd highly recommend this restaurant. I'd also feel very comfortable dining if I was travelling solo, as there was a range of seating, including bench style seating alongside the chef creating noodles."
1967,tedsook,Bangkok,Thailand,17-November-2016,"My girlfriend and I went to North at the Sands Hotel, Macau, in July 2016.

We weren't expecting much because there weren't many diners in, however, we decided to give it a try anyways as the prices weren't too expensive.

We order the Xiaolongbao as we've tried it from a few restaurants; namely Din Tai Fung who boasts this menu. Surprisingly, we find North's Xiaolongbao to be extremely delicious. The batter was made fresh and the filling tender with plenty of soup! We both agreed that sauce wasn't even necessary to enjoy this delicious delight.

We ordered some other dishes but the Xiaolongbao was definitely the one that stood out.

Highly recommended for anyone looking to have a delicious treat!"
1968,hkfornow,None,None,10-October-2016,"We were very disappointed with North as the food was very salty and unfortunately too spicy for us. Service was excellent though, unfortunately, the food was subpar."
1969,Nicole M,Weipa,Australia,15-September-2016,"This restaurant was a chance find whilst wandering aimlessly around the huge complex of shops and casinos. The restaurant seemed nice and we were welcomed by friendly staff. We initially had a few language barriers but we ordered 3 amazing dishes and I must say it is some of the best Chinese I have ever eaten."
1970,derekr172,None,None,5-September-2016,"This is my favourite restaurant at Sands Cotai Central Macau as they have a 5star service and food, when you are in Macao don't forget to visit North SCC.. you will surely love it as i do.."
1971,edwinbs,Singapore,Singapore,10-July-2016,"Perhaps this restaurant is just not to our taste, with their xiao long bao and dumplings thick-skinned, noodle chewy, and everything vinegared. But the chong qing chicken (i.e. fried chicken buried in fried chili slices) is quite nice. Or we are too used to how  northern  foods are cooked in Singapore.

Read a review from someone from northern China, not mine :)"
1972,Chris H,Makati,Philippines,2-July-2016,"We have been frequent visitors to North in the Sands over the past year when looking for a bit of spice.

Being creatures of habit we always go for the window seat with a view over the casino floor to give a bit more feeling of space.

Our favorite dishes are:

Slow cooked sliced beef with vegetables in spicy garlic sauce
Deep fried pork spare ribs topped with spicy peanuts
Tonghao vegetable with garlic

Staff are all good with one or two with with enough English to get us out of trouble.

Hotel Carpark downstairs and lift close to restaurant are all plus's... Don't forget to get parking card stamped

Recommend stopping for an ice cream some where on the way home when the spice and residual garlic needs clearing."
1973,GluttonOfTruth,None,None,29-June-2016,"Environment - good ambience atmosphere to have a nice dinner with business partner Food - delicious and authentic standard, servings are huge though for not so good eater. Service - a bit disorganized if its crowede Menu - variety of choice for Chinese foods"
1974,Summerfrolics,Singapore,Singapore,29-December-2019,"Went to the branch at the old Macau town side. Food was satisfying - had their minced meat noodles, fried mochi balls and a few other dim sum items. The two mentioned were my favourite! I think cafes in Macau tend to do their fried mochi balls very well. Their pan fried dumplings were good too. Do note that the restaurant is inside the casino itself -we had to ask for directions as we couldn't find it at first when we got to the hotel."
1975,247Carpe_Diem,Seoul,South Korea,19-April-2019,"No reservations required. You can always find a seat there. It is pricey but the quality is good. The casino in that area ia also good - nice and clean. There is designated room for smoker. After food u can walk along river and enjoy the view"

1980,cartagia,ireland,None,29-December-2018,"Well, what a shame. We sat in this restaurant for 15 minutes and were completely ignored. We had a central table and after being escorted to the table, all the staff completely ignored us. A huge shame because we stayed in the Wynn Palace and it was without doubt the best hotel we've ever stayed in and the service was absolutely fantastic with amazing staff. But Red8 and the staff let me down and let the whole hotel down. How can they be so bad whilst the hotel is so wonderful? Everyone in the hotel goes above and beyond for the guests but nobody in here even looked at us. This needs to be addressed. A disgrace."
1981,LinaJ470,Jakarta,Indonesia,20-December-2018,"Just enjoy ours dinner minutes ago, can't wait to share my review

Fair price good quality of tasty food plus excellent services is a bonus

We order Braised Eggplant salty fish and Waited prawns honey beans chilly sauce, Vietnamese port and pork offal in vermicelli soup all taste perfectly delicious

David and Cindy both very kind to us

Higly recommended to Red 8 excellent services"
1982,Hermann S,Bangkok,Thailand,5-December-2018,"This is the first time that I really enjoyed Chinese food in China! Well flavored and good meat quality, that is not what I'm usually getting there :-) Also the service was great and the prices were reasonable given the location in one of Macau's best Casino Hotels."

1984,Gregory S,Hsinchu,Taiwan,14-July-2018,"We recently visited Macau, and spent 7 day’s there. We found that the food options were good but were more expensive than expected.
One restaurant stood out for their exceptional value. When dinning at 8 you feel that you’re getting a great value for your money. The service was good, remembering you’re in China. 8’s food quality more than made up for their service.
I highly recommend you try 8 when visiting The Wynn Palace, or the City of Dreams neighborhood."
1985,bobboersen1607,Beirut,Lebanon,19-April-2018,"When I visit 5* hotels for a meal, I expect top notch food & service. I ordered the Peking duck which was absolutely divine. However, the service was far below par and I felt I was left to my own devices. Raising hands several times to get attention, not once a follow up. The design is very red which can be expected in China and its territories. It was average, the duck was great but doesn’t carry the experience on its own to say it’s worth another visit."
1986,Ryan G,None,None,29-May-2017,"Given that you are sitting in a restaurant in the middle of a casino and hear the noises of the slot machine while ordering food, the quality is quite outstanding. Simply put: The Red 8 serves extraordinary food in the middle of the Wynn Casino!"
1987,Maninawaz,Oxford,United Kingdom,5-May-2017,"I had the roast goose with rice and my wife had chicken. It was nothing special but filled us up. At the end of the day this restaurant is in a casino and it doesn't invite you to spend an evening there, despite the beautiful decor. If you want something quick whilst gambling then you can't go wrong eating here."
1988,39mfsh35,None,None,2-May-2017,"If you are staying around in house or that area. This Chinese restaurant is worth to try. They have got nearly everything, good quality of food with selections ,0 dim sum buns , rice , noodles ... etc. A 10% of surcharge apply."
1989,1993Kiwi,Auckland,New Zealand,23-April-2017,"This was our first dinner in Macau, and it was great! We ordered some dumplings, the sweet and sour pork, and some beef and tomatoes. The service was great (except the waiter accidentally knocked over my drink and split it). It took a while to find, as The Wynn is quite large. It's right next to the casino, so don't come here if you want complete silence - hearing the cheers from those whom won is great! Would come back!"
1990,Fabrice D,La Chaux-de-Fonds,Switzerland,12-April-2017,"Having the chance to visite RED 8 @ Wynn means you are over 21 years old (to go through the casino).
Then, that also mean that you might have loosen money and illusion in that precise casino. Still, go to the Red 8 to have a wonderful chinese full experience. Dim sum, Duck...everything as to be tasted and shared with your partners."

1996,DRLand,Wisconsin,None,18-February-2017,"My wife and I had a nice lunch here. We were surprised that very few of the staff spoke English but that seems to be the norm in Macau. For such a large tourist area we were pretty put off by that. Seems like they should hang a giant sign at the Macau Ferry in Hong Kong saying  Westerners not Welcome  (in English of course!). At least this restaurant finally found someone to speak with us and she was delightful. The food was good and the service was excellent."
1997,ctynemouth,None,None,9-February-2017,"Need I say more?! I grew up in Hong Kong so this is a bold statement but,hands down, i have never had a more succulent and generously prawn filled har gao in my life!
The other dim sum that we ordered was great as well but I will always remember the prawn dumpling!"
1998,cfinn16,None,None,4-January-2017,"Only eat here if you need food whilst gambling. No atmosphere, slow and not great service and very average food. Very little English spoken by waiting staff. Very overpriced drinks. Many great dining experiences to be had in Macau, not here though."
1999,Mandy H,None,None,10-September-2016,"At first I think this restaurant is expensive because it is located at Wynn. But I tried big congee (HK$28), fried rice($78) and veggies( $58) which is cheaper than Hong Kong and good taste of those dishes. I will come back to dine in this restaurant when I go to Wynn"
2000,eng333,New Jersey,None,1-August-2016,"I was really craving peking duck. I know the Wynn macau isnt exactly the place to go but when you have a craving, thats what you do. I got a half duck, it was pretty late so they had to check if they had any left (not exactly a good sign). It wasnt the best duck I ever had but not bad. It also was also reasonably priced."
2001,itaewon-mickey,None,None,18-April-2016,"Favorite place to eat at Wynn. Very good chinese meal (peking duck, dim sum) and located in casino area. Service is quick, food delicious, what more can you ask for?"

2005,DamianPiza,Mexico City,Mexico,11-January-2016,"Located inside the Wynn hotel. Staff VERY friendly and food spectacular...
Peking duck as well as sweet and sour pork and fried rice are amazing.
In the entrance you can see an open kitchen where they prepare/cut duck as part of the show.
Not as pricey as expected.
Great Chinese Food."
2006,Costas E,None,None,19-November-2015,"Best restaurant I have been to in hong kong and macau. Order the peking duck and pork sweet and sour. Service was amazing and very very reasonable prices."
2007,miamicane77,None,None,6-August-2015,"A great option in Macau. Service is good, place is very clean, food is excellent, and they never close! My favourite thing to get here is the Peking Duck."
2008,PranavFatmanTravels,Guwahati,India,23-July-2015,"Maybe it was the general mood but it was too simple and elegant a place inside the Wynn.
The place was classy no doubt and attracted a lot of diners mainly because of their seafood!
I did not try much of the food at the restaurant but my friends seemed to and the prices were reasonable as well.
I did try the Pork Dimsum with Spicy Sauce and it was phenomenal. My friends infact used that spicy soy sauce with all their other food to make them better.
So if you are looking for a good meal, then The Red 8 isn't a bad option but its a little between casual and fine dining for me."
2009,Cheapoldman,Beverly Hills,California,31-May-2015,"Located inside Wynn Macau. This place is good enough to take a rest or cool down in the hot sweaty weather of Macau in late spring or summer. There is nothing special in the menu that would make you want to come back. Service is not on par with the name bearing Steve Wynn. Waitress needed to be flagged down just to order. They just left you sitting on the table after you are finished. Most security personnel don't understand basic English that make it difficult to find places."
2010,bvanderet,None,None,22-March-2015,"Wonderful Asian dishes in edgy well appointed bistro. Great service, reasonable prices, nice respite from smokers."

2012,Natz1610,None,None,18-January-2015,"I went here thinking it would be similar to the Red8 at Wynn Las Vegas. I am used to western style Chinese and I found the menu quite scary. The chicken was served with bones sticking out. We walked out!"

2014,nicolawca,New York City,New York,19-May-2014,"We stopped here for a quick lunch. We were not disappointed.

If you have the composure, wait awhile before ordering. I noticed that a lot of the mainland china clientele ordered fried rice, egg omelettes, rice dishes and BBQ plates. We followed suit, and it was excellent.

They have an open kitchen [fronted with glass]. You may walk to the side and watch them prepare the meals. That was very entertaining, particularly watching the wok man keeping his wok cured and fire hot.

Great bargain for quality of food and atmosphere.

I recommend this restaurant."
2015,WKKL,None,None,9-May-2014,"Nice choice of food available. Good service.. English speaking staff. Decent selection of wine too. Truffel Sui Mai is very tasty..."
2016,Steve8010,Brisbane,Australia,18-April-2014,"This food was so authentic and terribly delicious. We recommend having a seat at the bar overlooking the wok station - it is such theatre to watch the chefs do what they do best and at such a pace that leaves you flabbergasted! The food was so good, we came back a second time during our short three day stay. Delicious!!!"
2017,itaewon-mickey,None,None,27-February-2014,"Great place for good Chinese food. Had a sampling of several dishes, including the peking duck, various dim sum and noodle dishes.

2043,awesome_world2010,Sydney,Australia,12-November-2011,"Macau is really a food haven because even the eateries inside the casinos serve delicious foods! I went to Red 8 for supper after a couple of hours wondering in Wynn.

Because it can be quite cold inside the casinos, I was craving some noodle soups and congee. I ordered some shanghai noodle soup and the century egg with shredded pork congee. Both were excellent but the congee was just unforgettable! The congee is so flavourful and they put a lot of century eggs in it as well. It was that good, because I came back the next day to have the same thing.

Red 8 also serve barbecued meats and a few dim sim dishes as well. I haven't tried the barbecued meats, but the dim sims are quite small in size (although it was really yummy, especially the chicken feet).

I will come back to Red 8 again not only because of the super delicious congee, but it has also very nice modern atmosphere. When I was dining in this restaurant, I almost forgot that I was inside the casino floor and I thought that I was in a fancy restaurant!"
2044,travelmaker4,Australia,None,11-July-2010,"Red 8 is a casual Chinese restaurant located in the Wynn Casino complex. Drinks available include beer and limited wine selection. We dropped in for dinner after having a look around the complex during our recent visit to Macau.

Many of the diners appear to be casino patrons, having a quick bite between sessions. Food was quite good and service was quick & friendly. Their suckling pork and roast duck with jelly fish were very good. Nice place for a quick but quality Chinese meal."
2045,Johann-Sandra,None,None,22-October-2009,"Red 8 seems like a pretty nice little lobby restaurant at the Wynn - waiters in black tie serve you, the menu seems okay. Unfortunately, your entire dining experience is spent in a thick cloud of suffocating smoke. Also unfortunate is the service - we had a difficult time flagging down people to help us throughout the meal, the waiter brought the wrong wine the first time, then didn't switch out the glass (from red to white wine glass). We asked a waiter if the beef was lean or fatty - he assured us it was very lean, then it was almost all fat. The Malaysian Noodles with Chicken Feet were in a weird soup - not tasty at all - and the Chicken Feet were slimy instead of crisp like normal. We were not impressed with Red 8."

I ordered just a bowl of shrimp wanton noodles soup. However, it was probably a disappointment, the noodles were tough, and had a strong alkaline taste.

The pork siu mai was divinity, as well as the roasted pork buns and the shrimp hargow. just by thinking of them i am already salivating.

The quality of the food was very good, crispy duck, pidgeon, kale, Beijing dumplings. Service was nice, no complaints here. But the place itself is hardly special and at more than 400mop is definitely pricey for this place, i can have the same quality food for much less in most Macau iam cha places."

Others are soup, sashimi section, dessert etc. Free flow of real juices also included. You can ask for complimentary coffee or tea too. MOP 328 per pax, worth it!!"
2083,Frappezz,Asia,None,2-December-2013,"The Rice Empire is an excellent restaurant serving a selection of favourite tapas, rice-based dishes, rice noodles and desserts from many Asian countries. Pho from Vietnam, Chicken rice from Singapore, Nasi Goreng from Indonesia, Katsudon from Japan and Rice in Hot Stone Pot from Korea are just some of the varied items on the menu. The restaurant is tucked away in a very quiet corner of the huge Sands Cotai Central Complex, away from the hordes of noisy, chain-smoking tourists from mainland China who descend on Macau by the busloads practically every minute of the day. To locate this hidden gem of a restaurant, look for McDonalds/Mc Cafe on Level 1 of the upmarket Shoppes at Sands Cotai Central Mall and walk straight till the end of the passageway and you'll find the Rice Empire.

The restaurant has a serene ambience with dark wood furniture set against pristine cream coloured walls adorned with pictures of paddy plants. The two English-speaking restaurant captains lead a small crew of waitresses who render prompt, attentive but unobtrusive service. The food is carefully prepared and scrumptious; the appetizers deserve special mention for tasting like the native version served in their country of origin and for being attractively plated. Individual portions of the main courses are big enough to serve two adults, and prices are a steal with most main courses priced between MOP68 (USD8) to MOP98 (USD12). The 10% service charge is waived for Sands Rewards Club members.

My dining companion and I shared an appetizer, a salad and rice dish (see photos). The chef transformed the plebeian Vietnamese rice paper rolls (MOP38) to a wholesome tapas with an irresistable contrast of textures with the addition of shredded beetroot, blanched plump prawns and generous slices of Thai honey mango. The rolls were served with a tangy spicy dipping sauce, as is done in Vietnam, but I found them to be excellent even without the dip.

The Thai Pomelo Salad was served in a deep bowl with big shrimps, plenty of fresh crabmeat and shredded kaffir lime leaf. I was happy the chef had a light touch with the chilli flakes, ground peanuts and fish sauce, allowing the distinct taste of the fresh ingredients used to delight the diner.

The Stone Pot Rice was topped with a chunky piece of flavourful and juicy pork loin that had been sauteed with minced ginger, julienned scallions and white pepper. The rice had absorbed the hearty gravy and scrambled egg, but the acid test came after dinner - we did not get thirsty at all, so we can vouch that this dish is MSG-free. As my dining companion was a member of the Sands Rewards Club, we paid only MOP48, ie half price, for this dish. (Each Club member is restricted to only one order from a list of four promotional priced dishes per visit.)

It was a pity we 'discovered' The Rice Empire on our last night in Macau or we would have had all of our dinners here. We are likely to stay on the Cotai Strip on subsequent trips to Macau so we'll definitely drop by again. It is great that this place stays open till 11pm, with no reservations required, at least for the time being."
2084,ChanZ,Singapore,Singapore,8-July-2013,"The only place in Macao you can discover Asian foods under one roof.

The Venetian we were informed about the closing time and we managed to reach well before the closing time... However there is no last order time for a set meal.

While disembarking from our high speed ferry from Hong Kong, we gave them a call. They said their reservations for the day were all gone but that they did accept walk-ins. We headed right to the Grand Lisboa, where the restaurant was located, and were told that it would be an hour wait, but they could accommodate us. We spent our time wandering the close by and got back at the appropriate time. The design of the space is quite calm and luxurious, as compared to the Grand Lisboa hotel and casino downstairs. From the metallic interconnecting  8  to the beautifully embroidered goldfish panels behind glass in the dining room. All servers and staff were elegantly attired, attentive to our slightest needs. My boyfriend, my sister, and I all chose dishes from the dim sum menu. In total, we chose about 11 dishes but that comes out more like 13 dishes as we were welcomed with an amuse bouche and finished with a complimentary dessert and cookies to take home. If you do decide to do dim sum here, BUDGET YOUR TIME as each dish is made to order and served individually. This was certainly a new experience for me and I thought it was worth the time and the expense. Dumplings came out in the form of goldfish with edible gold leaf, and other various whimsical shapes. And each dish was seasoned perfectly. Service was attentive with all our dishes announced as they were served and our cups constantly replenished with hot beverages. Having earned their 3 Michelin stars, they deserve every single one of them for this elegant and delicious meal."
2108,Kennywong667,None,None,30-December-2019,"Been here for birthday celebration with my girlfriend. The food is super good, the price is quite high so I expect they will have a bigger portion. We love the environment very much and it is romantics and quiet. All staffs are nice and full of smile.
One thing to highlight is, you must well prepare and book earlier, otherwise they will be full booking but it is definitely worth to go."
2109,Summerfrolics,Singapore,Singapore,29-December-2019,"Went there for dim sum on a Sunday. Must make reservation as they are really popular. Service was excellent, staff were very attentive. The dishes we had were generally delicious - very intricately made as well.
Our favourite were the goldfish har gao, the deep-fried gourd shaped mochi dumplings with pork and the siew Mai. The crab tartlets were ok - very cute though.
Do order their plate of xo sauce to go with the dishes too! It's very flavorful - I regretted not getting a bottle back. For two of us, we spent around S$200 for that lunch."
2110,LZ808,Hawaii,None,19-December-2019,"We visited The Eight restaurant for lunch and everything was not only delicious but also very creative. We definitely experienced an appetite boost. The staff were pleasant and helpful.

There is a dress code-men cannot wear shorts and no flip flops. It appears that they do have pant rental available at the front sure-not sure if the service is free.
We will visit again!"
2111,ylyuna,None,None,28-November-2019,"i never expected that i will enjoy eating here..the food is heavenly delicous..and its afordable...i will come here again next time"
2112,pulmbubble,San Antonio,Texas,23-November-2019,"The restaurant is a Michelin 3 star restaurant. They have din sum , and all different style of Guangdong. The decoration of the restaurant was amazing. It use gold fish as main design. The food taste nice. They mark start on their menu which is a must try. We try to order all their suggest which is good. Only complain was the red bean ice cream cake. It is too sweet. The service is a little slow."
2113,cinnamocrunch,None,None,17-August-2019,"Lunch was the highlight of our day trip to Macau, every piece of dim sum and every dish was beautifully crafted and presented to us. Service was wonderful and attentive (they changed our plates often, topped up our tea/water), pleasant spacious surroundings and not at all crowded. Can’t wait to return!"
2114,Jenny V,Kingscliff,Australia,17-June-2019,"This is our second visit to The 8 restaurant and we had to come back because it was so good the first time.
It didn't let us down this time either. When we had previously visited it was for lunch and Dim Sum, but it was a proper grown up meal for dinner. It certainly isn't a place for children and you have to make sure that you are appropriately dressed.
We tried numerous things on the menu which we normally wouldn't have which included Goose Liver and Turtle but none of it disappointed. The food was amazing. The wine was amazing - one thing that we thought odd though was that we picked our initial bottle of wine and there was going to be a ten to fifteen minute wait to get the wine from obviously where they store it. We decided against that and chose one that they had in-house.
Majority of wines are by the bottle, not by the glass so be aware of that. Wasn't a problem for us, but may be for other travellers.
Would we go again regardless that it costs a small fortune for the meal - Absolutely! Worth every cent."

2117,bets_my_name,None,None,29-March-2019,"Goldfish theme at the restaurant simple and elegant. Dim Sum was very pretty and fancy. Thanks to the chef’s amazing artistry. Excellent service by the staff. Overall, it was a lovely experience for my partner and I. Highly recommend this place."
2118,m3tpe,San Francisco,California,4-December-2018,"Made the reservation 1 month in advance. Wasn't too hard to secure the reservation, but they have a bunch of policies which made things annoying. My seating was 11:30am for 3 people. We sat down and ordered the set menu for 3 people, which was 3000MOP total. Service was extremely lacking as tea was never refilled on time and never hot. Supposedly they should have someone that keeps refilling and making sure tea is properly refilled when it's included in a set menu.

Food was nothing spectacular or amazing for a 3 star restaurant. In fact, some of the dishes were overly seasoned and tasted very heavy. They also lacked the basic culinary skills of making a perfect ChaSiu, which you can find in small food stalls all over Hong Kong. Any small hawker restaurant in Hong Kong can serve up some bomb ChaSiu over noodles. This place served heavy veined pork, which was tough and hard to eat. Responded our opinion about this dish as none of us finished. Manager was notified but he never came over to check on us. They didn't care for customers complaint.

They also rushed the last 3 dishes because they needed to flip the table. Last 3 items were all served at once and we could only eat one at a time. The other dishes were room temp by the time we got to it. Definitely spoiled the quality and taste.

Not sure why these Michelin Inspectors gave them 3 stars. Maybe they don't know anything about Cantonese cuisine. Wouldn't recommend."
2119,dhui,Hong Kong,None,24-November-2018,"the overall dining experience was smooth and nice, not much surprises and excitement given it's a 3-star restaurant.

the dining environment was grand but not having a comfortable feeling. the abundance use of marble made the background a bit noisy to be honest.

food quality was good, but not surprisingly good.
we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing, the wines selected were a bit disappointed given 3 out of 4 wines were white wine, and the red wine was not ready to drink, too much hard tannin. we understand we can't complaint much given it's just an additional $1,000 for 2-pax wine pairing. yet when it comes to visiting a 3-star, budget shouldn't be an utmost consideration. I would suggest they offer an option of wine-pairing for selection.

lastly, the offer of eff tart and Hong Kong style milk tea was a joke to us. The restaurant was serving chinese cuisine instead of Hong Kong's!

We heard their lunch time dim sum was good, possibly a wrong choice on visiting for dinner."
2120,paxso1,Makati,Philippines,26-October-2018,"To be honest not sure if this restaurant is what I was expecting or used to when I heard 3 Michelin stars. However as a Chinese restaurant the food was very good. Slightly on the expensive side but I guess that’s what the Michelin is for. It’s vegetarian friendly. One of their signature dishes is the the black truffle fried rice. Highly recommend this restaurant."
2121,Janli0104,None,None,13-October-2018,"This review is mainly for the poor service and how inflexible this so called fine dining restaurant handled reservations.

Do not come here if your child needs to sit on a high chair. They have sofa tables but apparently those are for 6 guests only(we are a party of 6adults and 1 baby 1.8yo) we mentioned that we wouldn’t mind to sit a little closer to each other but the staff insisted that would be against their policy!! And other guests see that might complain or something!? I seriously didn’t understand what she was saying but if the restaurant is not children friendly then why don’t you just tell us children are not welcome????!!!

They suggested that they will TRY to look for a high chair somewhere from the hotel but they do not guarantee if they can get one! If this is how again a ‘fine dining restaurant’ referred by that staff, sorry the service is not really fine dining standard!!! So we ended up cancelling the reservation and went somewhere else instead!"
2122,Agnes S,None,None,10-October-2018,"We ordered a few appetizers. The chilled shredded chicken with bean sheet pasta and sesame oil ( 手撕雞）was very good, particularly the pasta. But the crisp frog leg was better in form than the taste, as frog leg itself was not so tasty.
Among the main dishes we ordered, the roasted pork roll with asparagus and green apple was surprisingly fresh , while the signature dish suckling pig with fried rice lived up to expection and also filling. The beef loaf on the other hand was not finely cooked enough.
The vegetable with lily bulb and birth seeds was most refreshing.
The service and settings were excellent.
Overall the price for our reasonable dishes was also reasonable. So this restaurant is recommended."
2123,catherina0380,Taipei,Taiwan,30-September-2018,"This is my third time to have lunch here. The flavor of food are still amazing. The service is still perfect. The price is also reasonable. This time, except ordering Dim Sum, we also ordered 手撕雞、烤鵝 and fried vegetable, it tasted great! I told myself, I will try other dishes next time!"
2124,Lee_B_LosAngeles,Los Angeles,None,21-September-2018,"As mouthwatering the pictures of the dishes are on the internet, they were as good and giggle-worthy in real life.

We went on a Friday night. The place was not overly crowded. We were still able to carry on a private conversation in our group. We had reservations but had to change the time and they were so accommodating.

Service was excellent at this resto. Normally, Chinese servers and wait staff in Macau and Hong Kong are not the friendliest (this is the consensus among our travel group), but not at The Eight. Everyone was so nice at this place and served us with a smile and did not appear to be in any rush.

Food was ah-ma-zing! I still dream about the dishes we had there. If you want elevated ultra fine dining Chinese food, this is the place. So go ahead and splurge!"
2125,nutniykaye,Naga,Philippines,15-July-2018,"Heard lots of wonderful things about this 3 Michelin Star restaurant so we went ahead and tried it. We ordered a full course set and since it was my birthday, my husband ordered their signature Baked Alaska cake. We were initially worried that the experience would be underwhelming since we had lunch that day at another famous Michelin star Chinese restaurant (and loved it). Anyway,the moment,we reached the Eight,we were impressed by the entrance. Automatic sliding doors, cascading water...that really set the mood. Our server explained the dishes,their origins,the ingredients,etc. It's small things like these that really make the dining experience complete. But at the end of the day,it all comes down to taste. And at the Eight,we enjoyed almost every single dish that was served to us. The silver needle jasmine tea that came with the set was so good (and helped calm our tummies coz we were already super full waaay before we reached dessert). That said,their portions are just perfect. We couldn't finish my ice cream cake but we each had a slice and it was amazing (perfect coz I'm a fan of red bean). Finally, we were gifted with complimentary egg tarts and milk tea-- as if to say  Welcome to Macau . Lovely dinner."
2126,alano643,None,None,9-July-2018,"Visited Macau, couldn’t get reservations to Robuchon Au Dome, but I was able to get dinner for two at The Eight on a Saturday night!

From the moment you walk in your are greeted with excellent service staff and a grandeur interior. Many many choices but we opted for the “Signature Dishes Set Menu,” and were not disappointed.

Everything as far as service was superb. The food was also excellent. The portions appear small, but by the time the wanton soup came we were stuffed.

Highly recommended and would go back! Worthy of the Three Michelin Star rating."
2127,sunilaga2k,None,None,5-July-2018,"The eight restaurant at Lisboa hotel is around 100 years old and provides a large variety of Cantonese cuisine , there is more than 40 types of Dim sum . More than 10000 variety of wines . Great"
2128,mermaid719,None,None,17-April-2018,"It is a very lovely Chinese restaurant, deco is elegant, quiet with quality food. It is not a cheap restaurant, but they have excellent food. Put a lot of thought into their dim sum. Their other dishes are all excellent too."
2129,nickJ4005HT,Richmond,Canada,26-March-2018,"I am normally not a big fan of dim sum but The Eight is exceptional. We chose dishes which were superbly hand-crafted as well as delicious --- char siu buns shaped as hedgehogs, shrimp dumplings in the shape of gold fish, lobster dumplings wrapped in jade colour delicate skin, pastry with shrimp and pork filling in the shape of a suitcase and many more fantastic offerings. The service was attentive and excellent but not intrusive. The waitress sees that your tea is close to finish and fills your cup with piping hot tea (nothing is worse than lukewarm tea). The dessert gelatin comes in the shape of gold fish --- a white one for coconut flavour and a yellow one for mango accompanied by a fruit sorbet. The presentation for each dish is elegant and artistic. Reservation is a must if you don't want to be disappointed. There is an amuse bouche before the dim sum you order arrive and also mini complimentary Macau egg tarts to end your meal."
2130,Fiona B,Milan,Italy,9-March-2018,"We went here for the last evening of our China trip and it was well worth it.Set in a beautiful room away from the chaos and noise outside in the hotel. We had the tasting menu with paired wines and it was all exceptional. The quality of the food was excellent and the wine pairings were an opportunity to try some outstanding wines.
The service was very attentive and a special mention must go to Nick Koon ,the sommelier, for his helpful and friendly attitude and particularly for his choice of wines."
2131,TwoFrews,None,None,28-February-2018,"The food, the service, the presentation, the ambiance, not sure what more i can say, but absolutely amazing."
2132,Gem0521,Oakland,None,19-February-2018,"My family and I were visiting Macau again and I had wanted to try this place for a long time. Finally remembered to make a reservation in advance (this is recommended via their website). They're very accommodating when it comes to the number of dumplings you need for your group. There were four of us and they were able to add an extra dumpling to the dishes that normally come in an order of 3. We were pretty impressed by the presentation as well as the quality of the food. The price was very reasonable for a 3 star Michelin. It's pricer than the majority of the dim sum restaurants you're used to but the quality is also much higher. For the four of us we paid $2088 MOP and we were stuffed. Highly recommended. Will go back again!"
2133,George K,None,None,8-February-2018,"The food is good and should come to enjoy it, however the service quality is very disappointing. No service sense at all and just act like a robot with procedure. Definitely not a 3 stars restaurant."
2134,Phillyjanie,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,9-January-2018,"I booked my New Years Eve dinner here and was I glad that I did! First, don’t overdress...just look spiffy and clean and you will fit right in. Second, put yourself in the waiter’s hands. He recommended a delicious mix of dishes that I adored. Third, prepare to be impressed....the food is more than good. Each plate is a work of art. This is why The Eight is one of the top 20 Chinese restaurants in the world."
2135,LeCutMx,Mexico City,Mexico,7-January-2018,"Super disappointing experience. I had read rave reviews about this restaurant. I wouldn’t give the food and service a single star. I think I’ve had better meals at PF Chang’s. The food wasn’t bad; it just wasn’t what I expected. However, the plating/presentation and concept of the dishes was at Michelin Star level; though definitely not three."
2136,DT8888,Singapore,None,16-December-2017,"We dined at the Grand Lisboa’s two 3 Star Michelin Restaurants on consecutive days. Already reviewed Robouchon yesterday which was just amazing. Today’s dining experience at the Cantonese 3 Star Restaurant ‘The 8’ - was also highly pleasurable but on a like for like basis Robouchon wins hands down. The service was extremely attentive but no matter what it cannot shake off the typical family style, whenever its ready in the kitchen service sequence. Family style servings can never match the intricate plated service presentation of a top notch western restaurant.
The 8 Signature dim sum is enjoyable but some seems more for the cute factor (Goldfish shaped) than taste. Granted the meal for 4 was only half of that compared to Robouchon but still no contest."
2137,lax-sas,Dubai,United Arab Emirates,1-December-2017,"We were very much looking forward to a very special dinner at the Eight, which is one of the 3-Micheline star restaurants in Macau.

The design of the restaurant is beautiful, linking to the number 8 and Chinese gold fish - both lucky symbols.

We order the signature course and this came highly recommended.

The 8 dishes were were quite good, but did not meet my expectations for a 3-star restaurant. nothing was rally exceptional, the wagyu beef course was not well matched with the sides and the mango dessert was a real disappointment - which we refused to eat. The signature dim sum very, which are special design of the Eight were not on the menu.

Service was attentive, but little busy. Worth to mention is the really outstanding wine list with some 16 thousand different labels, esp. from Burgundy, Bordeaux and Germany.

All in all a pleasant dinner, but far from our expectations."
2138,SallyF1063,Singapore,Singapore,28-November-2017,"Appalled by the fine culinary craftsman of the Dim Sum recommendation by Nick Koon... when we were seated, Nick is so attentive and detailed in his recommendation and we took his word for it... what amazes us is that he is not the Restaurant Manager, which is normally the case. As a wine sommelier, he is definitely well versed in the menu selection and his recommendation blew us away...

As for the presentation and taste, we must say, this is truly a Michelin Star restaurant worth dining for, make us happy just by looking at it...... we went there for lunch and it seems value for money too...."
2139,dailulu,None,None,25-November-2017,"You better do reservation before going. 95% time are full. Food is great, service veru good, price not expensive!"
2140,Christopher Joh... H,Sydney,Australia,17-November-2017,"I shared with a friend of mine that I had a booking at The Eight before I went to Macau. She's a bit of a dim sum aficionado, and warned me  all those places with the beautiful dumplings often don't taste good- they are too focused on the presentation and not on the flavour ... well I can say that in the case of The Eight, she was dead wrong.

From the moment you walk into the restaurant you know you're in for something special- the entrance is through a darkened hallway where images of fish nibble at your feet. The service is flawless as well.

The food- however, is what you came for, and it doesn't disappoint. Each dish was creatively presented and had a delicate balance of flavours. Hints of truffle, fresh prawns from New Caledonia, delicate ginger....

The price was not cheap, but consider it a once in a lifetime visit!"
2141,Silversurfermigle,None,None,14-November-2017,"Top Food, nice atmoshere. Best winelist and super service. This place is worth the longest travel. We loved it!"
2142,Navigator22,Singapore,None,27-October-2017,"A very elegant 3 michelin stars modern chinese cuisine restaurant. The dimsum here is not only excellent but painstaking done with such craftsmanship that it was almost a shame to eat them. But ate them we did, and the taste does justice to such culinary art work. Also memorable was the suckling pig - in a heart beat - the best I ever had. And the beggar's chicken was as authentic as one can get, baked so well in clay- retaining all its natural flavour and the chicken was succulent in its own juices. The dessert like the dimsum was playfully creative. We had alot of fun sampling them.

The decor of this place was very elegant and tastefully done. My only complain was the service level as a touch and go. Depending which waiter/ress you encountered, they could be efficient or totally clueless and indifferent. It is seems only the maitre d has sufficient knowledge of the food and no one else. So for that - I cannot give it a full 5 stars. Still if you are in Macau - do make an effort to dine it. You will not regret the quality of food. And best come with a party of 6-8 - so you can try as many different dishes as possible as the servings can be quite large."
2143,JazzyLovestoTravel1,Singapore,None,8-October-2017,"I absolutely LOVED the Eight the last time I was there in March. This time around I was very disappointed. Did the original chef leave? Or did we just get the B team because the usual staff is away for Golden Week? Would love to know if this is a permanent change or a temporary glitch.

The service is no longer impeccable and intuitive like the way it was. In fact it was extremely rushed with no consideration for the pace of the meal. The food is no longer delicate. The goldish seems to be missing some fins and the new  goose  looked more like a weird flamingo with neither the wings or the beak being remotely tasty.

The main dish like braised pork was undercooked and the worse I've had in any restaurant, let alone a 3 michelin star restaurant.

If the original chef has gone, please would someone let me know where he/she has gone off to?

I miss the old stellar restaurant."

2146,stansoft,None,None,27-August-2017,"I had a dim sum at The Eight at Grand Lisboa hotel. It is enjoyable to see the eye popping scuptures in the hotel lobby on the way to the restaurant. It is overwhelming experience even before going into the restaurant. I ordered several signature dishes and my favorite abalone dish among others.
The food quality is simply the best among all michelin star catonese restaurants I have been to including Hong Kong. It may have been westernized rather than pure cantonese, but to me, it was THE BEST. The price was amazingly affordable. I originally expected to pay twice as much. The only less competitive price performance was abalone. But still worth while to try.
The service and environment with a large space was really nice. You are treated like a royal customer.
I wish I can go to The Eight often. If the bridge between Hong Kong and Macau is constructed, it will be more convenient to visit. I am waiting for it."
2147,William K,None,None,6-August-2017,"Excellent food and service. Chinese dim sum 3 Star. The best dish is the piglet rice. It is not terribly expensive. Worth a try."
2148,Brian E,Bangkok,Thailand,5-July-2017,"Visited The Eight as part if a work visit to Macau, I didn't know much about the restaurant other than it is supposed to be 3 star Michelin cuisine. We had a large group of 18 people so we had a private dining room with a private restroom - nice touch there.

I was pleasantly surprised by the warm greeting we received by the staff, I'm still in HK mode I guess. We were taken to our private room and drink orders were taken quickly.

The food we were served was a set menu. While very good I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This may be down to the fact that I don't partake of Chinese cuisine often so maybe I have an unsophisticated palate in that sense. The colleagues that I dined with all insisted that the food was amazing and genuinely seemed to enjoy everything so this is perhaps down to my personal preference.

Overall a very nice and extremely upscale restaurant. If you are looking for a great Chinese meal in Macau you could do far worse. I did not have to pay so I cannot comment on the prices but I was told that it is very pricey but this is Macau so that should come as no surprise I guess."
2149,teoweme,Singapore,Singapore,27-June-2017,"Decor was nice and service was amazing (several people attending to each table), though they do rush you to keep within the time limit.

Food was also very pretty especially the dim sum that looked like various animals. However, would not say the standard was worth the high price. Desserts in particular were nice looking but not spectacular.

Would still go again just though, as overall its pretty good."
2150,Helen Y,None,None,18-June-2017,"The first impression not that good as they do not have a table larger for 13 of us. We needed to split into two tables for father's day dinner. Despite we had already told them that there's a kid and a total of 13 of us, only 12 sets of tableware setup. The quality of food is good though, but interesting that most of the food are not 'hot' enough..maybe they had to prepare 12 sets and hard to keep the temp. Good restaurant but located in a not so good hotel though. Just note for others, we were asked to buy a $2000 champagne as to get the 6 corkage fee waived"
2151,chillipadichua,Singapore,Singapore,18-June-2017,"Went for dim sum lunch in one of the VIP rooms which had an attached washroom inside. Decor of place is posh and elegant with a nice water feature.

Dim sum items are intricately shaped in the form of goldfish, crabs, handbags etc. Took quite a while for the ordered items to arrive. Taste is ok as I felt that the dim sum skin is too thick probably cos of the shaping.

Did not like the attitude of the staff in the main dining hall because they were not very tactful when they told us not to sit near its water feature for photo taking. Come on, if guests spend so much and want to take some pictures of the feature plus it really looks like a waterfall with ledge meant for sitting, should try to accommodate or reject with more tact. How about putting a sign  do not sit  to avoid any misunderstanding?

May not visit again"
2152,Wendy W,None,None,14-June-2017,"We came here for dim sum after seeing all those lovely pictures. The taste is right but one very important issue for good dim sum is that they are to be served steaming hot which the restaurant failed in all dishes.

I must admit that their service is really good and attentive, though."
2153,MadmanAdventure,None,None,7-June-2017,"This is a very high class with the freshest ingredients being dished out to all its patrons. The food is heavenly and the staffs are very attentive and professional. It's costly but it is definitely worth it. I will be back for sure:)"
2154,LuLuCNL,None,None,25-May-2017,"We had dinner at the Eight with my old mother who was in a wheelchair. Since there were 10 of us, the restaurant informed us when we made the booking that big groups must dine inside a private dining room with a minimum charge. That was weird but we thought it was OK. When we arrived at the restaurant, the nightmare began. We reached the reception counter to find out that there was a stair leading to the reception counter. The two nicely-dressed lady staff saw us coming but showed no intention to help our mother moved up the reception counter. So, we had to do it ourselves. We were led into the restaurant but was just surprised to find more stairs inside the restaurants with no access for people in wheelchairs. I believed the restaurant had never thought of serving people with disabilities or at least providing training to their staff about how to assist people in wheelchairs.

The dining room was dark, and we could see dust falling from the ceilings. Many of us were allergic to dust and so we kept on coughing and sneezing, and our eyes were itchy. Although most people in Macau speak Cantonese, one of the ladies who served us did not understand Cantonese at all, let alone speaking Cantonese. So, whenever we talked to her, she started her reply by  Sorry, I don't understand  and we had to go outside to get another staff or just wait inside the room for help. Throughout the dinner, at least one staff stayed inside the dining room and closely observed your every move. There was no privacy at all and I was not saying this meant the staff would be very attentive. The staff appeared very cold and indifferent, and robot-like. Their presence just made you feel uncomfortable and uneasy.

As for the food, the quality was just average and not as good as other Michelin-star Chinese restaurants in Macau and Hong Kong. I could not remember any dish that was worth mentioning. At the end of the dinner, my sister paid the bill. Yet, when we were leaving the restaurant, my sister was called back, because the staff found out that they had overcharged her...

I am a very tolerant person, but I can't stand this restaurant at all, because they showed no respect and assistance to old people and people with disabilities."
2155,지현 킴,None,None,9-May-2017,"Feeling the beautiful space, eating beautiful food becomes healing. Staff recommended Dim sum is delicious. The menu that I was impressed with Bbq Pork Bun and Puff Pastry with Squid Mousse and Scallop in Mango Sauce."
2156,JazzyLovestoTravel1,Singapore,None,16-April-2017,"What a steal for a 3 star Michelin restaurant!! No expense was spared at this joint. Obviously the casino revenue is doing so well that using the best ingredients and being the best is all that matters.

The attention to detail from the scale of the goldfish to the the precise crispness to chewy ratio is mind blowing.

The servers are so on top of it hat she even knew exactly how many dishes we had left without checking.

The decor is only so so. Very old school - reflective of the owner"

I am impressed by quality of services and suggestion of food selection among how busy they are. The food is amazing nice presentation with best selected ingredients . Somehow the taste of the foods are good but not as good as I expected from 3 Michelin stars. The tastes are not impressive as i usually have from 3 stars restaurant. But overall, she is one best restaurant and worth visiting. Very grateful for her hospitality."
2159,Immortalist,None,None,31-March-2017,"I'll begin by saying that I visited this restaurant specifically for the dimsum so that I can compare apples to apples. Being the only 3 Michelin starred Chinese restaurant in Macau, I do have high expectations and I have to admit, the experience started out a bit bumpy due to a case of miscommunication, whereby waitress somehow thought that as a single diner, I would order the entire full portion of multiple dimsum dishes when I had in fact already verified with her couple of times that I was ordering one person portion of each dish (which other Michelin star restaurants here had been able to accommodate). Thankfully, when I raised this with the manager, he was able to rectify right away and the rest of the experience went without a hitch. Taste-wise, it was definitely good and the presentation was beautiful. For single diners, it's recommended that you contact the restaurant in advance to let them know you're looking for single person portion so that there won't be any confusion upon your arrival. Would I dine there again? Definitely."
2160,mdroc1,Melbourne,Australia,30-March-2017,"This restaurant has three stars and on the basis of the food alone, I struggled to understand how they achieved one star.

The wine list is amazing and setting is grand. The service is solid, but obsequious which resulted in some surprising 'schoolboy errors.' Example: wait until everyone has finished their dish before clearing the plates. On two occasions, I had a waiter standing close by waiting for me to finish my last mouthful and then quickly whipped my plate away.

Down to the nitty gritty of the food.
I was served a soup with abalone and black chicken. The soup looked dirty and eating the abalone was like chewing on the inside of a golf ball. Perhaps it wasn't supposed to be eaten and was just added for flavor?

The waygu beef roll had a hot filling which made the dish unbalanced. The beef was overcooked in any case and really didn't do much for me.

The lobster was not bad, but the dish overall was bland and a bit messy, though lobster can be that way.

One dish was a mix of steamed vegetables - completely bland and no creativity whatsoever. The quality of the produce seemed good, but bordered on simple home cooking.

The noodle dish had something fine and crunchy added, which was obviously added to give it texture, but ended up making the dish completely gritty. Again, bland and boring.

Dessert was a sickly purple pudding with sago, which literally came out of the fridge, so they didn't really plate it with care just before serving.

Overall wouldn't recommend, but apparently their dim sum at lunch time is something to behold. Prices were reasonable."
2161,Ro_Rodel,None,None,16-March-2017,"This is one or not the best Chinese restaurant ive been through..the restaurant is fine dining with tall and beautiful chinese server..its a high class restaurant the food is excellent and very unique in design.."
2162,viaggio1994,None,None,31-January-2017,"The Eight is one the coolest Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. The decor is chic with Chinese characteristics. While the restaurant was quite full the night we went, the seating arrangement gave lots of privacy to diners. The food was simply amazing. Everything we ordered was unique and tasty. No doubt it has 3 Michelin stars."

2164,schmidtmg,Switzerland,None,17-January-2017,"The Eight has three Michelin stars since 2014, and the Grand Lisboa is the only hotel in the world with two three star restaurants under its roof (The Four Seasons in Hong Kong had two 3*** as well until Caprice was demoted to 2 **). We went for a birthday lunch with a group of five and ordered generously from the dim sum menu. The dim sum is top notch, and if my sister in law and mother in law from Hong Kong, who have eaten in hundreds of dim sum places all over HK, nod repeatedly with approval, it must be good. Order a special mushroom XO sauce to go with the dim sum - it's a special item on the menu and only HKD 45. The presentation of some of the dim sum is spectacular - pork bun in form of a hedghog, crab and prawn dumpling in form of a gold fish etc...... The wine list must be one of the most comprehensive in the world. We were probably the only guests to order wine with our dim sum, so we had the sommelier to ourselves for the entire meal. The 2010 Condrieu from Chapoutier was excellent and quite fairly priced. We will gladly return here."
2165,raymondtmfbaker,Karlskoga,Sweden,15-January-2017,"Well over the past week I have eaten at most of the best restaurants in Hongkong. If you are looking for what could be the best dim sum on earth look no further. Considering this being a three star Michelin restaurant your expectations should be high and lots of things here hot the markers. Service is as close as it gets to being perfect. Food is fantastic and the tea was really good. We had a slight tea incident when the tea (waiter) axidentley poured tea on my plate but that was taken care of no hassle. All dim sum here were excellent but I really liked the ones that were made up to look like something els. The goldfish were just adorable. The restaurant was nice and the entry door was pretty cool. The main waiter was really informative and the menu at this restaurant is really good. The variation of dim sum is impressive.

If you have only one place ever to eat dim sum this is it.

Thank you for the whole dim sum experience!"
2166,MrWarrenM,Crown Point,Indiana,4-January-2017,"The location for The Eight is hard to beat as it is located within the Grand Lisboa Casino, a beautiful building both inside and out. The Eight is an elegant restaurant with a menu of mostly Southern Chinese cuisine. The restaurant is most famous for its Dim Sum. The Dim Sum was incredible. The price was also incredible."
2167,disalada,Bangkok,Thailand,2-January-2017,"We are Michelin hunters and I will have to say this restaurant left me slightly confused. In my opinion this place does not meet the standards of 3 star Michelin. I am talking mainly about the service and the food. We did a set menu with wine pairing. We all felt the same that the wine pairing was just...off. The taste of off the food was so average. I would not recommend this restaurant to Michelin lovers."
2168,samSG81,Singapore,None,26-December-2016,"We came here to celebrate our 17th anniversary seeing that it was recently given its 3rd star. The entrance created a magical illusion of entering a lake and the ambience and wait staff were very good.

There ends the compliments.

The food was ok without being bad but difficult to justify it's 3 star status.

As the dinner course was winding down and I was 1/4th into my taro pudding dessert, I found a strand of curly (definitely pubic) hair embedded in the pudding. It was disgusting.

The wait staff offered their sincerest apologies and offered to replace the dessert with any other dessert item on the menu. However the damage was done and cemented my thoughts that The Eight is definitely not worthy of even 1 star."
2169,tetris2015,Bluffdale,Utah,19-December-2016,"We made a reservation a week in advance. We were so excited to try this place after reading many reviews on Trip Advisor. Sad to say this Michelin 3 star restaurant should maybe pass as a 1 star.

The reason for this review was that the server was arguing with me as to what I should and shouldn't order. I was appalled. I even filled out the satisfaction survey they brought to the table stating the same thing.

Normally the guest can ask for suggestions or recommendations but I wanted to order what I have seen others order on here and I lost the battle. I wanted more appetizers and less main dishes to try many items.

The food was excellent tasting the experience of being put down on what I wanted left a bad taste in my mouth.

Not sure I will ever come back to this place. Going to a Michelin 3 star tomorrow afternoon in Hong Kong and expect to be blown away."
2170,foodvindicator,Rome,Italy,15-December-2016,"I went to this restaurant attracted by the 3 michelin stars, which, based on my experience, are not warranted (and the rating I gave is based on that). I also wanted to try the tasting menu but, alas, it is only available for two (big flaw! Several other high end restaurants in Macau have it also available for one person). Yet I had an overall positive experience and I would recommend it. The ambience is very beautiful and the 2 waitresses who attended me were smiling and corteous. They guided me through the (long) menu and explained in detail the dishes I had chosen. These were braised shark fin soup with egg white and crab meat (so so: too much crab and very little shark fin); deep fried sole with spicy salt (nicely crispy but far too salty) and smoked pigeon flavoured with premium Oolong tea (absolutely wonderful, was worth the whole meal). Amouse bouche and a small egg tart were offered at the beginning and at the end of the meal which was very nice (and were both very good). A small incident (the charging of a sauce which I thought was for free) was quickly and professionally resolved by removing it from the bill. All of the above, with a side of rice and Chinese tea for slightly more than 500 MOP, which I think was good value for money. I would give it a second chance."
2171,Tim0thy88,Singapore,Singapore,12-December-2016,"The 3 Star Michelin restaurant entrance was very grand, walking through sliding doors and some water features at the side. Ordered as much Dim Sum we could eat as the restaurant's vibe was good and had previously heard many good reviews about Eight. Most of the dishes were very good and some with very interesting presentation. Dining experience was good and would definitely revisit when i am back in Macau!"
2172,Steves_Rickshaw,Seattle,Washington,2-December-2016,"Overall I don't think I would go back or recommend.
The interior is beautiful. At least the entry and the few tables at the center of the restaurant. But we sat off to the side and I looked at a boring wall.
The menu is incredibly overwhelming. We asked for recommendations but nothing sounded sincere but rather a canned response. The one recommendation we did order was extremely boring.
The wine list was mostly by the glass and a few bottles. We weren't familiar with any so asked the sommelier. He also wasn't much help. He bragged about the largest wine collection in some region (forgot exactly where he said) but then he wouldn't provide a full wine list. Seemed very odd. Then if the wine cellar is so big, why is the one wine that we order off of the small recommended wine list out of stock? Big fail!!!
We ordered one starter to split and two mains. Would not order any of it again. Maybe we ordered wrong. They had some very expensive prefix menus but I think because ordered a la carte the bill was somewhat reasonable."
2173,RichL009,San Diego,California,27-November-2016,"Popular restaurant which made Michelin 3 star list. It is a nice setup in a casino. I found the dim sum is overall interesting and has some good dishes. The environment is nicely done.

A few things to bear in mind before you venture into this: 1. A reservation is absolutely required; 2. The casino is very unfriendly to visitors. There are limits to many areas and bodyguards are all over the place. So unless your reservation is ready, there is nowhere to rest in the casino/hotel; 3. Service is not the 3 star they claim."

2176,CWU,Aachen,Germany,21-November-2016,"Before making reservation at The Eight, I compared all Michelin star restaurants in Macau and came to the conclusion that The Eight has the best reviews AND the best values at the same time.
So I reserved a table for 5 persons, including two kids (age 12 and 10). When we arrived, the staff greeted us friendly and showed us the way. The interior is traditional and modern Chinese at the same time. Everything in this restaurant is classic, from the tableware to the staff. We ordered several Dim Sum, Chinese tea and orange juices. The Dim Sum looked great, smelled delicious and tasted delightful. I wish we had more time in Macau so we would have tried all the dishes on the menu. The starter and dessert were on the house which was a generous gesture from the restaurant.
Later in Hong Kong we tried another Michelin star restaurant (2 star) and it was not as good as the Eight and was much more expensive. We didn't order much that day since we had big breakfast at our hotel and brought 2 kids with us, the staff still treated us nicely. Thumbs up for everyone working at The Eight for a wonderful dining experience. I wish The Eight opens one near my place so I visit it as frequent as possible."

Wow, the presentation of the food here is just out of this world. I mean seriously the food looks so good I did not want to eat it! I tried the famous dumplings that are shaped like gold fish wow those were good. I had the amazing pork buns shaped like porcupines and lobster dumplings. I wish I could have ordered more but I simply couldn't eat another bite."

The food for dinner and lunch was excellent, the food quality at its utmost and was very yummy which was impressive. The service was impeccable, waiters recognitzed us and treated us in a very friendly manner. The ambience was very excellent, it was located in the 2nd floor where the atmosphere was nice and lots of decorations was evidenced inside the room. However, my only consern was the dark corridor leading to the toilet, powered by three automatic doors, and when a person in white walked by, he/she seems like a ghost, scaring people off ther nerves. The value was very expensive but as the food was nice, it was reasonable."

2184,mmyl201,None,None,31-August-2016,"Its Michelin three stars are well deserved. Spectacular food, especially the cantonese dim sum dishes. Service was not up to standard as most staff are not professsionally trained. But still worthy of the three stars as you cannot find better food and ambience elsewhere in macau. Try to come for lunch rather than dinner as you get the same menu, plus dim sums which are not served at dinner."
2185,KattJB,None,None,30-August-2016,"At 3 Michelin stars I was expecting the best of the best. The food is really tasty and staff very nice (although when they discovered my other half spoke Chinese they completely stopped speaking English to me and only addressed him) but I've definitely had better at lower rated Michelin restaurants. I'd recommend a visit for the good atmosphere and some fine dining versions of Chinese cuisine. The dessert is definitely the best dish!"

The food is fantastic and exquisitely handmade- every food item is so beautifully made. We tried the abalone tart, porcupine char siew bao, green mushroom dumpling, yellow siew mai with a gold topping, char siew (very delicious - soft & juicy), roast pork, goldfish prawn dumpling and several other dim sum. I think it is value for money considering the exquisite decoration of the food as we spent S$100/- per pax. Needs advance booking."
2187,Raymond T,Hong Kong,None,24-August-2016,"The number  8  is auspicious to the Chinese since it represents luck and prosperity. In this case it also means  good food . Located at the Grand Lisboa in Macau it has a stellar reputation and my first encounetr over lunch last week was proof. The dim-sum menu was extensive and the presentation definitely on the creative end. What I enjoyed the most was their modern interpretation of classic Cantonese fare, some of them outstanding. One of their signatures has a hint of Portuguese cooking and that is the Roast Suckling Pig which, despite the genius of taste, was a bit hard to watch visually as it was .. so young, so tender, so innocent and of course so delicious. My other favorites were the frog legs and eel, they are must trys! One more thing the service staff is very well trained by any standard. Mostly from locally or China their English standard is good, and for the senior waitress who served our table she was explaining to us her understanding of  Amuse Bouche  .. and we are talking about a Chinese restaurant in Macau. Bravo!"

We are guest there, treat us the way we deserve.
For me service meant everything. And their service is such an put-off, I wont even be paid to go back there!

The whole dinning experience felt rush and immature, the waitress are unprofessional.

To be frank, it is just DimSum that is made to look-like goldfish, and other animal shape, which I am certain after few lesson of play-toh on my own, I can manage to make dimsum better than whatever that was on my table."

Food was good : very nice barbecued pork, spicy shrimps...The shredded chicken with pomelo being one of the highlights
Good...but not great, and imho not deserving 3 Michelin stars
The thing which is worth 3 stars is definitely the wine list...probably the best in the world, and definitely the largest...very hard to not find any bottle you might want to try...at a  reasonnable  price compared to what you can find in other restaurants"
2197,324kristinec,None,None,30-May-2016,"Food was nice there, nicely presented with cheap price. The food truly deserve a Michelin star.

But the service was terrible.

Table was reserved a month ago for my friend's birthday. We changed the date and time via email afterwards and the lady replying copied and pasted the wrong info, not expected from a Michelin 3 star.

We have preordered the suckling pig rice as well as some buns for celebrating my friend's birthday, here comes the problems.

The waitress told my birthday friend that we have reserved the buns, with wordings -- great! Ruined surprise.

We requested to have the head on for the suckling pig, no one has ever declined the request when I made reservation.

But eventually they gave us a pig butt with rice stuffed inside. We asked for what happened and the Assistant Manager on duty said their staff has told us we cannot request for part of suckling pig, everything is decided by the Chef but not them.

She even said she has already heard of the recordings of tele conversation, but when we requested to listen to it, she hesitated with a 'fed up' face and gave us reason 'the recording is in the office which is not available.

When honesty is not valued, what can I expect from this restaurant? The AM said she would send the recordings to me that night, but until now, more than one week, I received nothing.

We didn't want to argue with staff, we just wanna know what has happened. But the attitude of staff was really terrible.

What a disgrace."

I went there for dim sum lunch and arrived at 1:20 for 1:30 booking. And waited until 1:50 to get the seat. It's ok because I wanted to try this restaurant for ling time. However we ordered dim sum and some dishes at 2:05 and they arrived at 2:50. The service is really really slow. The dim sums are creative but the taste is nothing special. The worst thing is the vegetables were cold when it was served. The price was high , around 1800 for 4 persons. I could have had better dim sum if I went MGM or Wynn or even Altira. Disappointing! P.S the waitress are not friendly at all, never respond to us when we ask something. Just asked to wait. Speechless!"

The Eight is located in the Grand Lisboa hotel. Walking into the restaurant, we noticed that the decor is very modern and contemporary…not typical of a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Precious prix fixe menu as the waitress mentioned that this was the most popular. We were very impressed with the food.

Started with a amuse bouche of abalone-filled dumpling shaped like a abalone. a small whole abalone accompanying it. My favorite was the next course…roasted pork and goose. crispy skin…juicy meat underneath. We also had a traditional shark fin soup…a fairly large whole piece, not small shreds like most restaurants. This was a braised whole abalone which was cooked perfectly. The steamed crab claw, vegetable dish, and lotus-wrapped rice were very good as well…but not as memorable as the first few dishes. We finished off with a coffee gelatin. The food was very fresh and very good quality.

The service was excellent also. The waitresses explained the courses as they were presented. They brought out a tea cart and provided tea service…explaining the different flavors and adjusting it to your taste. Very personalized attention as they keep coming over to check on you and to refill your tea.

overall, a great experience and great food."
2207,eat1226,Manila,Philippines,24-January-2016,"Our group of 8 people had lunch at The Eight on Jan. 20. Prior to that, 8 required us to email a credit card guarantee because we were booking a big table (they only have few big tables in the restaurant). This was not standard practice at other fine dining restaurants in Macau but we complied nevertheless.

Our reservation was at 1:30 as requested by the restaurant in adherence to their 2-shift policy at lunch time. Because we were traveling with my 95 year old mom and a few seniors, we decided to arrive earlier in anticipation of their slower movement. We arrived at a little over 1pm and immediately approached the reception. The receptionist informed us that our table is not yet ready since it was not yet 1:30 and we should just wait. I requested her for a chair for my 95 year old mom so that she may be comfortable while waiting (there were no seats at the reception area). She immediately said that that was not possible and that there were  no chairs, no chairs . I further suggested that maybe my mom can sit inside the restaurant while waiting. Again the receptionist replied that it was not possible. Frustrated, I commented that service is not good here. She just ignored me. Thinking that maybe she does not understand English well, I made my request in Mandarin. Again she refused to accommodate my request. She did not also make any attempts to consult with her supervisor or manager. We had no choice but to walk a distance to get inside the casino for my mom to sit.

When we returned at 1:30, she made an effort to assist my mom in walking down some steps. But I guess the negative first impression had been made and whatever attempts at service just cannot erase the initial negative feelings that were generated.

8 had been one of our favorite Macau restaurants for the longest time due to our previous experience of great food and service. At that time, I made a promise to myself that after this incident, I am never coming back to 8. Fortunately when we started to order, our server Vivi Hui made us feel welcome. She was cheerful, patient and knowledgeable. When we informed her that my mom had a shrimp allergy, she made sure to inform us if any of our orders had shrimp in it. She also informed the other servers of my mom's food allergy. She also recommended food that my mom may like that do not contain shrimp. Overall it was Vivi's great service that made me change my mind about 8 and willing to go back another time.

The other servers who were also friendly were Trista Lu and Wendy Lv.

After our meal, we were given an opinion form to fill up. I recounted the incident with the receptionist in hopes that she may be further trained to anticipate customers' needs and  delight  the customer. It would be a pity if a restaurant such as 8 will have its reputation smeared by an initial negative impression, such as what happened to us.

I was surprised when that very afternoon, the manager of 8, Mr. Norton called me up at my mobile number to ask for details of the incident and to apologize for it. He further thanked me for taking the effort to document the incident to aid in further training. It was a very good gesture to win back a customer and I was quite impressed by it.

People such as Mr. Norton and Vivi are the reasons why we will go back to 8... in addition of course to the great ambiance and food quality."

The food was tasty and well presented such that each dish was worthy of a photo as a reminder. I'm sure it was expensive but my friend paid so I can't comment much. As with a lot of fine dining places you eat for the experience and not to stuff your belly!"
2213,jackhon800,London,United Kingdom,17-November-2015,"They get the service, ambience and deco 100% right and you will struggle to find a Chinese restaurant that comes close to matching those three things in Macau.

I am maybe being a little bit harsh with the 4* but I felt that their Michelin star now means that they have to achieve everything 100% to justify that rating and also its cost that comes with it.

I thought some of their dishes were a little hit and miss but on the whole there were some outstanding food, including the black & white sesame roll for dessert, the shrimp puff pastry, abalone puff pastry and the goldfish dumpling were delightful."
2214,Brian S,None,None,14-November-2015,"With a few restaurants in Macau steadily declining, it's nice to have a staple I can go back to with consistent quality and service- unlike Robuchon in the same building."
2215,57kated2015,Blackwood,Australia,26-September-2015,"Having never dined in a Michelin starred restaurant before, I have no comparison to make. Our lunch today was stunning. From the sliding door entrance, the water feature opening into a very classy, refined room everything was beautiful. Gorgeous table setting (use the black chopsticks to take from the main dishes & use the white ones to eat with), excellent service & advice re the menu. Started with the prettiest & tastiest dim sum, then ordered mains. Only disappointment was that we forgot to visit the rest rooms - I'll bet they were stunning too!"
2216,Summer W,Melbourne,Australia,23-September-2015,"Probably should lower down your expectation about this michelin star restaurant a little. The food and table presentation is good but some dishes are overrated. Some of the dishes are too salty and lost its authentic flavour. However, the customer service and the ambience is good for a lunch with friends or family."
2217,Discerning_Patron_GB,London,United Kingdom,22-September-2015,"Don't bother. Its Michelin stars are a total red herring.

Went for dinner. Chose wide selection of a la carte dishes.

Food was good. But not great. And certainly not memorable. No innovative touches. No flair. Just competent Cantonese food. Roast goose was good. Wagyu beef tasty but unrefined.

Service atrocious. Didn't explain dishes. Didn't understand simple allergy request. Relentlessly topped up tea cups to the point of intrusion. Service was muddled, impersonal and haphazard.

I have dined at many Michelin-starred restaurants. This was undeserving of a single star."
2218,andiey5,None,None,28-August-2015,"The Dim Sum were good, services were attentive and caring. However , the food was very average. I could easily find many Chinese restaurants in Macau could have done better, in terms of tastes. For a three starred restaurant , I certainly expected more."
2219,Tychoo72,Singapore,Singapore,17-August-2015,"One of the best chinese restaurants in macau. Great timsum and a la carte dishes. Of course it comes with high price too. For those who are willing to spend, please visit. Tried the char siew, roast pig, and 八宝鹅, also the timsum, worth eating! One thing that disappoint me, being a 3 stars michelin chinese restaurant (only 2 in the world), they do not know how to serve chinese tea! The tea leafs are soaked in the tea pot, for all who know the art of drinking chinese tea will know what i mean."
2220,Will L,None,None,12-August-2015,"The food are tasting good and nicely decorated. The dim sum dishes are of very high quality. However, they have dressing codes for men only including boys above 3 years old that you must observe before you can enjoy the food"
2221,Yummydelight,Singapore,Singapore,12-July-2015,"Decided to visit the place after seeing photos of the Goldfish dumpling. However I was a tad disappointed when mine wasn't as pretty as the ones I've seen. A few of the dim sum items scored full marks for presentation such as Baked Tartelette with Crabmeat in Curry Sauce and Puff Pastry with river shrimp in purse shape. The life-like gold fishes on the partitions were impressive. The only let-down was the 1.5 hours time limit for dining.

2222,Wanderer1A,Hong Kong,None,2-July-2015,"The Dim Sum is innovative with high quality ingredients delivered in a unique way.

Service is superb and our waitress kindly offered recommendations as to what we might enjoy! Loved the pan fried bbq pork dumpling served in the shape of a hedgehog!! So cute.

A Dim Sum lunch here is great value for money, five dishes to share plus non stop jasmine tea between two people came to MOP 450 including service.

A must try if you're in Macau but recommend you book in advance."
2223,Simon K,None,None,28-June-2015,"Very good style Chinese restaurant. Excellent food and great service like you would expect. we had a great meal dinner. Totally recommended!"
2224,MariaM933,Manchester,United Kingdom,13-June-2015,"A restaurant with a grand entrance,serving modern dim sum. Not the best dim sum I ever had,as I prefer the dim sum restaurant in Hotel Lisboa. Service could also be improved considering its a 3 Michelin restaurant. My friends from France, who had many previous 3 Michelin restaurants experience, were not impressed with the service provided but did enjoy the food and loved the design of the restaurant."
2225,Hsu Y,None,None,19-May-2015,"The cutest dim sum ever had, and it comes with great taste. Good selection of glass wine, a glass of German Riesling GG for 100 MOP, and Caymus 2002 for 120 MOP, would re-visit."
2226,Lexus76,singapore,None,13-May-2015,"Just to share my experienced in this restaurant.
The ambient was good and service is excellent. Never come a cross a restaurant with so many waiter and waitress and food serving is fast.
A special thanks to Ms Candy who always recommend the best and innovative dishes."
2227,DANET65,St. Petersburg,Russia,29-April-2015,"Everything about this fine dining restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the Grand Lisboa hotel is top quality, indeed: the interior decor, ambience, service, and above all, the food. Incredible both the taste and presentation. Besides, the visit does not ruin your budget. Lunch for two (no wine) was about 80 Euro, worth every cent!
If I travel to Macao again, I will definitely repeat the experience and try more dishes from their extensive menu."
2228,Dipsygreen,Antwerpen,Belgium,27-April-2015,"Do not compare 3 Michelin stars in Macau with 3 in Belgium. The dishes leaving the kitchen are just awesome, for me this was the best Chinese cuisine I ever enjoyed having.
Absolutely worth the 3 stars.
The winelist? Just to die for.....
A must visit for anyone seriously interested in good food and wine."
2229,546franckf,None,None,18-April-2015,"Its a nice place to have dinner or lunch .Chinese Food , very good , anything we ordered was very good.Its nice decorated . Waiter have some difficulty to understand english, but enough to take the order. Place to go back..."

2231,447reinerg,Augsburg,Germany,9-April-2015,"I went to the eight yesterday the second time and i was not disappointed. I went there with a friend for lunch. We had a reservation and it is definately important to book in advance as the restaurant is not very big. We had some of the dim sum dishes and all of them where wonderfull presented. I love the idea of dim sum looking like hedgehogs or goldfishes. Of course the taste was wondefull too. In addition we had some of the meat dishes . Same here, great presentation and amazing taste. The service was very professional, as you expect it from a star rated restaurant and all the waiters and especially the floor manager gave us the feeling of beeing home. Everybody had time to explain the dishes and for a smalltalk. So we loved the atmosphere there. The winelist is the biggest i ever saw and you can find great varieties from all over the world and in all pricelevels. We loved the experience there again and where surprised by the relatively low price for the quality you get, compared to other high class restaurants in Macau. So it will not be my last visit at the Eight. It´s my favourite chinese restaurant in Macau."
2232,MariaM933,Manchester,United Kingdom,7-April-2015,"Took my french visitors to this 3 michelin star chinese restaurant, and they were very impressed. The entrance is glam, the restaurant is nice, dressing code is not as strict as Robuchon, however service wise, maybe I am more award of  chinese service , but my french visitors were not impressed with the waiters as they lack the attentiveness service of a 3 michelin star. Having said that, they really enjoyed the food and loved the deco. Personally, I think you can get the same if not better Dim Sum acrossed the road in Hotel Lisboa, but as a place to take your visitors Eight is spot on. Very good value indeed."
2233,Alex S,Milan,Italy,6-April-2015,"Other reviews seem to praise the dim sum for lunch, but unfortunately dinner was not even worthy of a  nice  restaurant let alone one with 3 Michelin stars. The atmosphere was like any other family Cantonese restaurant, with people texting (with full sound on) and taking pictures often throughout the meal, not the elegance I expected. Most tables had 8-10 people or a smaller group in a business meeting, and was not the romantic dinner I had hoped for.

The food did not live up to the Michelin standard either. The various dishes (roast goose, shark fin) were average, with no special or particularly good flavor. The meal was very disappointing, and definitely not worth the price. The only good things I can say is that the servers tried hard and the wine list - shared with the other restaurants in the Grand Lisboa - is excellent."
2234,513kianl,Frimley Green,United Kingdom,5-April-2015,"The Eight is hands down the best Chinese restaurant in Macau by a country mile. I have had the opportunity to dine here twice - both occasions were for lunch although for one meal we exclusively tried their dim sum and on our more recent visit we indulged in their lengthy ALC menu.
The decor of the restaurant is designed to symbolise wealth and prosperity no doubt for the many diners who hope to transfer some of that onto the casino tables. The front entrance is surrounded by the number '8' motif before you are led in view a small passage which goldfish motif into an opulent room decorated with more '8' and goldfish motifs.
As would be expected in a 3 Michelin Starred establishment, the menu features all the lux ingredients you would expect in Chinese cuisine including the controversial signature dish of Giant Shark Fin in Brown Sauce. A nice touch is that they spend as much time with the presentation of the dish as they do with the delicate flavours.
Service here is superlative and some of the best I have encountered during my travels. Needless to say, if you want one of the best examples of high end Chinese dining, the Eight is an excellent choice."
2235,MtlFam,San Diego,California,30-March-2015,"Hong Kong and Macau are definitely  FOOD  destinations, and this place was at the top of our list!
The service and the food were faultless. We did not have a reservation at 1:30 on a Monday afternoon, and fortunately we were seated right away.

We ate dim sum dishes. The prices were not significantly higher at this restaurant than others, but the quality of EVERYTHING was exceedingly high. The portions were small to average in size, but did not leave us hungry, despite having a relatively small meal. The presentation of some of the dumplings ins shapes like animals was particularly ingenious. The waitress assisted us in ordering and gave us perfect advice."
2236,Arnaldogonc,Tavira,Portugal,16-March-2015,"This is a good, nice Chinese restaurant away from the crowds that take away the enjoyment of having a good meal in good company. The menu is diversified, with the Cantonese cuisine making the most of recipes. The ambiance is nice, chic, confortable. The service was somehow lazy the last time I went there for lunch. The list of wines include very expensive wines. We run away from choosing one. Lisboa management prefered to pull the level to international Casino style standards but we are not in Las Vegas or Monaco. A meal will go around 50 US per head."
2237,Reslimpan,None,None,14-March-2015,"What a great place. It's a steal for dim sum. Innovative takes on dim sum and creative plating. The staff is knowledgeable and are happy to explain the dishes and how to enjoy them best. 5 point for this 3 star Michelin restaurant."
2238,ramenpop,None,None,3-March-2015,"So pretty dimsum to eat. Service of the staff was great. While the flavor was a little plain."
2239,Haeadie,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,25-January-2015,"We came here for dim sum and were blown away. The photos on here show you how amazing the food looks but not how great it tastes.

Best dim sum I have ever had. Go with the recommendations of the staff!!

The other fantastic thing is the value given that it is a top restaurant . Less than £50 for two people. We ate a lot of dim sum for that!!!

( when we were there the dress code didn't seem to be being to strictly enforced - several men in trainers and sports style tops)"
2240,OneRosyth,Singapore,Singapore,31-December-2014,"After looking through the dim sum menu and the main course menu, we (my wife and myself) realised that we might have to come back numerous times to explore the entire menu. To begin with, they have really have a lot of interesting dim sum items and dishes that you don't get in a typical dim sum restaurant. We ordered a couple of hot favourites and other more adventurous ones.

They presented a complimentary starter, mini abalone in soup stock with with crunchy vegetables. This makes a great starter as the tender mini abalone in soup stock smoothen the throat for our feast that we were greatly looking forward to.

To our surprise we were presented with 蓝天使银金鱼饺 3 Gold Fishes (steamed prawn dimpling). They look so cute that you probably don't want to bite into them. The prawns are fresh and the dumpling skin is thin and smooth.

Next, we are presented with the 鲜虾肠粉 (Steamed Shrimp Rice Roll). This dish was presented with much less of a fan fare but I have to say the soy sauce that accompanied is fantastic.

We were wowed by the next dish, 河虾肉鬆手袋酥 （pork floss with scrimp in a bag; I think it has a little taro). Look at the delicate work on the handbag. The chef has deep fried the  bag  and tag on the handle. The amazing thing is that you don't taste or smell oil or even feel greasy. Definitely one not to be missed.

Then come our 番石榴脆皮鸡 (Roast Chicken with Guava Sauce). This come across as a common dish that you probably can get from most Chinese restaurant. However, the chicken is roasted with perfect crisp and non greasy. The meat is so tender that you can go without the sauce. Behold, the sauce when poured over changed the taste with the chicken now coated with a tainted sourly taste that goes superbly well.

The next dim sum comes on just appropriate, 鲍鱼羊肚菌鸡粒酥（abalone with morels and dice chicken) . If it has been presented right after the starter, the it would have been a little overdose of abalone. Beneath is a flaky pie crust that contains the morels and dice chicken. I would suggest that you take them separately. First you get to enjoy the braised mini abalone and then the  chicken pie  with morels.

After which, we had the 香煎琵琶燕盏 (see picture in background)，this is probably the least exciting dish because the presentation is not outstanding and we could not taste the bird nest. Not much to shout about.

The last dim sum dish, 高力海鲜球 (Seafood in a Ball). The seafood containing inside the deep fried ball taste like seafood salad with crab meat, scrimp and fish paste all mixed with a tiny bit of mayo. The crust of the ball is hot when served and taste awesome even when eaten on its own. It has a light salt beaten into the flour and the crust is again non greasy which makes you feel so much less guilty.

To end the dim sum, they presented a complimentray small cup of hot milk tea (a little too sweet) and a mini portuguese egg tart.

All in all, the meal was full of unexpected surprises and the delicate dim sum craftsmanship totally blown us away. The food is awesome and the visual is the icing on the cake.

You should definitely visit for this exhilarating dim sum experience."
2241,flavorsoflife,Bangkok,Thailand,14-December-2014,"in the grand lisboa hotel, the 8 restaurant brings dim sum to new heights. this hotel amazes me with their F&B bringing in the best chefs. They cannot do wrong. The 8 serves dim sum. Amazing decor in a large restaurant but well designed so that it is intimate and quiet. The food was delicate and very fine. Your hau gow had the thinnest shell shaped like gold fish. The char siew bow was done like little hedgehogs with sesame seeds as eyes. It was fluffy on top and crispy below. wow, never thought that dim sum could be this good. Skip the tacky display in the lobby and savor what food should really taste like. Even the 1-3 star michelin chinese restaurants in Hong Kong all pale in comparison"
2242,commonest,None,None,8-December-2014,"The presentation of dim sums are great. Very cute. Taste is good. However, lunch is a little rush. Perhaps it's because they serve two rounds. Waitresses might be a little pushy but that's not their fault."
2243,worddict,singapore,None,21-November-2014,"Of particular note was the char siew cheong fun which had salted vegetable in it, giving it a unique flavour.

Also, the crispy skin char siew pau in porcupine shape was lovely.

The chicken in the claypot rice was too salty and although the flavour of the Chinese sausage was excellent, I felt that the flavours didn't permeate into the rice.

We also ordered a steamed bun dessert in the shape of a snowman. It was delicious and tasty fun to tear down the snowman."
2244,carolannt,Los Angeles,None,18-November-2014,"Hard to say what I disliked...I loved everything and I've been spoiled because they customized the 12 course dinner menu especially for me, according to my food allergies. And what they did was absolutely fantastic. I told my friends I had an orgasmic food experience there. Not sure what I preferred either but the crab leg in egg white surprised me when I thought that I was completely full. I couldn't believe that I was able to eat that much but it proved me once again that when you enjoy what you eat with no guilt, you can't get sick with indigestion. I also appreciated the decoration, typical Chinese and very chic. I highly recommend this restaurant."
2245,Jay E,Sydney,Australia,15-November-2014,"The Eight has a dramatic entranceway which sets the tone as you then walk into a nicely designed  theatre for fine dining. 

The menu is huge, in fact it seems too big as it's hard to narrow choices down at first (although it's logically set out making it easy to avoid entire sections - e.g. Sharks Fin, which I find inappropriate and offensive). Many of the dishes are accompanied by photos which is also helpful as you navigate your choices.

No wine list was offered with the food menus, but when asked we were given a card with  by the glass  options, and an iPad with the cellar database. The iPad seemed a great idea as there appeared to be an impressive cellar to choose from but we were unable to navigate the app and gave up - there was no offered help let alone a Sommelier - so we we ended up picking a glass of wine from the handful listed on the separate card. A bit of a lost sale IMO.

Service was polite and prompt. A little too prompt at times - e.g. My wine glass was whisked away before I'd quite finished (and there was no offer of another glass), plates were removed while we paused to talk or rest but were not finished with them, and overall there was a slight sense of rush that didn't suit the experience.

On the upside, each and every dish was fascinating. We sampled a variety of new tastes and I feel the chefs should be very proud of their skills, this really was a very good dining experience for us (LOVED the deep fried egg whites with seafood mouse and chicken - amazing!)"
2246,AneleW,London,United Kingdom,10-November-2014,"Upon entering the restaurant you feel that you are certainly away from all the noise from the hotel and casino. First looking at the menu I was completely lost and really didn't know what to do re ordering as there was just so much choice. We then asked if there was a tasting menu which fortunately there was. The meal was very good with a mixture of textures and tastes. The service was excellent and notable that there was all female staff which is unique for a 3 star Michelin restaurant and a breath of fresh air with great competence. The pouring of the tea was an artistic event in itself. The price was very reasonable and much cheaper with a better meal than Lung King Heen in Hong Kong. Highly recommended."
2247,DCaprilee,Washington,DC,2-November-2014,"What a fantastic meal! We went for lunch and it was the best dim sum ever. Each course was exquisite in the presentation and each mouthful was delicious. Even three months later, I can close my eyes and savor the delicate, intricate flavors. Shockingly, the price was more than reasonable. Don't bother gambling - just eat every meal at The Eight."
2248,Pala49,Brooklyn Park,Australia,21-October-2014,"this restaurant made a great overall impressions. The decor was impressive, the staff were very good and the food was as good as we have eaten anywhere.
Others have described the decor well so i will focus on the food which was outstanding. We enjoyed every course with none disappointing. The staff were very attentive and gave good advice on selecting food.
Every effort was made to see our needs were met."
2249,Placidrain,Hawaii,None,9-October-2014,"Perfect dining experience from beginning to end at The Eight. Once you step inside the entrance of the restaurant, you are transported into a calm oasis.

I was originally drawn to the Eight because of their intricate Dim Sum presentation, but ended up going for dinner instead. I made reservations in person several days prior as their phone reservation lines don't open until after 9:30 am.

The service and food was just outstanding! If you are a small eater like me, The Eight offers half portions for some of their lobster dishes (we had the Boston lobster in black bean sauce---it was cooked to perfection!). In the event you find yourself ordering more food than you can handle, they can package it nicely for you (they will even throw in a re-useable chopstick). Although not all of the waitresses spoke English, they assigned us one that did and was super attentive and friendly.

Tea service are additional, but they offer unlimited refills. Even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge with every bill, service was so amazing that we felt compelled to tip extra.

When the bill arrived, I was shocked—surely they must have forgotten a zero somewhere. I suppose it's because we didn't order alcohol that it came out to way less than anticipated. You could spend as little or as much as you fancy from their dinner selection, either ala carte or through their set menus --->

If you are a wine lover, you would probably be delighted by the Hotel's large selection (The Grand Lisboa has a list spanning over 580+ pages/ 14k+ bottles; no wonder they were awarded the Grand Award by Wine Spectator). ---->

http://www.grandlisboahotel.com/glweb/winelist/Grand_Lisboa_Wine_list.pdf

The perfect ending to the meal was their complimentary mini egg tart (personally I thought it was better than Lord Stow's) and milk tea. I can't wait to return to Macau to eat here again!"
2250,KJPSemaphore,Semaphore,Australia,4-October-2014,"The restaurant has an impressive 3 Michelin stars, and is one of the only 2 Chinese restaurants to achieve this in Asia. You enter the Eight through a secret dark passage where the walls are made of cascading water and clever lighting creates an illusion of walking through water with swimming fish.The dining area is spectacular with marble floors, tables with mother of pearl inlay and large goldfish decorations on the walls. Mr Au Kwok Keung runs the kitchen with a mainly a Cantonese menu. The dim sum menu was extensive with 50 dishes to choose from. We shared steamed blue shrimp dumplings in the shape of a goldfish, pork buns shaped like hedgehogs, money purses and other savoury courses including goose stuffed with mushrooms. Dessert was genuinely impressive and I had the sesame dessert. The winelist, which is shared throughout the Lisboa restaurants is one of the most comprehensive in the world. We decided to sampled a bottle of Tattinger French champagne which was a good price
Without doubt this was an amazing experience and one I would highly recommend."
2251,Bertha Y,None,None,30-September-2014,"Reasonable price for a Michelin 3 star restaurant, that's why you must leave within 90min. If you have more than six persons, you must book a private room which had minimun charge MOP $4000. Anyway it worth to try."
2252,Sheepo,Hong Kong,None,28-September-2014,"Remember to make online reservation well in advance, it is available to book on its website. We went there for lunch and it has a very creative dim-sum menu. Even I do not eat meat (fish seafood okay), I can pick plentiful of interesting dishes to try like blue Shrimp Dumpling in Goldfish shape, dumpling w/whole abalone, Alaska crabmeat rice roll, bird's nest puff pastry, bird's nest desert & more. And it is not only looking good; it tasted very good as well. Service was excellent and the total bill was very reasonable. Highly recommended!"
2253,YKitK,Singapore,Singapore,26-September-2014,"Meal: Dim sum lunch
Suitable for: a lazy weekend brunch with friends/ family.

Pros: food that combines the best of innovative ideas (e.g. abalone amuse bouche, goldfish shaped prawn dumplings, porcupine shaped pork buns) and traditional skills); very attentive and polite service, value for money.

Cons: slightly over-the-top decor, food portions can be larger."
2254,OhSwan121,None,None,24-September-2014,"Impressive dim sum presentation & great ambiance. The highlight is the goldfish projection in hallway. Unfortunately, the food quality could not persuade me to return."
2255,OrangeWhale,Singapore,Singapore,9-September-2014,"The dim sum were delicious, and the chef took pains to present them in an interesting manner. We were surprised by the designs and had great fun taking photos for my niece and nephew. We enjoyed the meal very, but would enjoy more if the wait staff were more attentive and warm.

Overall, will still come back here just for the sake of the interesting dim sum."
2256,Maisha R,None,None,16-August-2014,"One of our fellow hotel guests in Hong Kong highly recommended that we try The Eight during our day trip to Macau. And boy, am I glad that she did!

Tucked away behind an automatic door on the second floor of the Grand Lisboa Hotel and Casino, the dining room at The Eight transported us to a culinary haven. Extravagantly designed with dropped chandeliers and goldfish images on the lighted walls, the decor was impressive. As one of last parties seated for lunch, we essentially had the restaurant to ourselves. We were a little rushed to order but our waitress offered some suggestions for their more popular dishes and dim sum items.

We started with amuse bouches of minced meat, as well as abalone and pomelo, which was so delicious and refreshing. Shortly after we finished those delightful bites, our table was filled with shrimp dumplings in the shape of goldfish, pan-fried barbecue pork buns in the shape of hedgehogs, sauteed cristal blue shrimp with cashew nuts and bell pepper in chili sauce, prawns with eggplant in pumpkin sauce, braised lamb brisket, sauteed kale with dried shrimp and shrimp paste in casserole, and honey beans. Dessert may have been the best part of the meal. We enjoyed mango and coconut pudding with coconut ice cream, and a puff pastry with sweetened winter melon paste in the shape of a chick in a birds nest accompanied by pear sherbet. The baked alaska with red bean sherbet was set ablaze at the table and it was the best baked alaska that I've tasted.

The entire meal was incredible and the presentations were so inventive. The service was attentive and exquisite, which reflected the pride that they take in their food and in their 3-starred Michelin restaurant. Eating at The Eight was definitely a memorable experience!"
2257,laichunman,None,None,5-August-2014,"The dim sum is good, the service is good, the price is reasonable, the atmosphere is good, the decor is good.... What more you can expect? The only thing to remind is, booking in advance is a must! Walk-in dinning is almost impossible!"
2258,xbdl,Singapore,None,3-August-2014,"The restaurant setting is very luxurious, a mixture of dark and red furnishings. Once you stepped in, you are just wowed by everything.To save cost, we chose from the dim sum menu. The dishes were all so delicate that you couldn't even bear to eat them. You could see the effort being put into preparing the dishes. Goes without saying that the food is tasty, one of the best dim sum I had. Service was very attentive. The waitress continuously top up our tea. Great attention to details. The cutlery is normally located on the right side of the table but one of the waitress immediately shifted one set to the left upon seeing that my wife is left handed."
2259,R22LCW,None,None,23-July-2014,"The 3-Michelin-star Chinese-style restaurant “The Eight” is one of the top-class in Macau. Yet, its quality outputs are quite price-reasonable as different from many at that level. The dishes are well-served by highly-selected young waitresses dressed in cheongsam. One can really get immersed at foods and at their appearances simultaneously. The restaurant’s location on the Macau Island is easily accessible by foot and by public transports, which is an important point to many travelers in this today’s congested small city.

I would recommend trying “The Eight” for lunch first and choosing the various dim-sums such as shrimp dumplings, porcupine-like roasted port bun that is, in my view, better to have its bottom fried for a while before being served on the table. Bigger choices are Barbecued Pork (玫瑰蜜汁叉燒), Deep-fried Cristal Blue Shrimp Mousse filled with Goose Liver Pate (鵝肝醬藍天使蝦丸), Chilled Shredded Chicken with Bean Sheet Pasta and Sesame Oil (麻香粉皮手撕雞), Fried Rice Vermicelli with Shark’s Fin and Shredded Conpoy (桂瑤魚翅炒米粉), etc.

At the end of the meal, a tiny Portuguese tart and a small cup of milk tea, both not on the menu and not for take-away, will be followed to draw one's quick return. There are two notes for patronage at “The Eight”. The first is to book in advance. The second is to go in the number same as provided for the advance booking. Otherwise, any additional patrons may not be allowed to sit together as a rule to maintain their comfort standard even though to one's eyes, the table could be large enough."
2260,Staidthere,Jakarta,Indonesia,10-July-2014,"The Eight is a unique Macau casino restaurant with lots of space between the tables, self-opening doors, a really impressive entrance, creative and fun-loving chefs, and cheongsam-clad waitresses with limited English who try very hard to please the small proportion of their customers who can’t speak Cantonese or Mandarin . We don’t feel that the restaurant should be judged by Michelin restaurant standards because about 80% of visitors to Macau are from the mainland. About 4% of visitors, and thus their customers (if they like Cantonese food), would be from Hong Kong or the West. Waitresses and supervisors are still struggling with English. For instance, neither our waitress nor her supervisor knew the Cantonese word for “oyster sauce” until a manager stopped by our table and told us. We were charmed by the culinary artistry of the chefs who formed the crispy barbecued pork in bak pao bun into the shape of what we thought was a hedgehog and cut a cherry tomato into the shape of a rabbit. We enjoyed also their mango and pomelo pudding and sesame pudding with sesame ice cream. We felt the price was quite reasonable compared to Hong Kong prices. It's good to book ahead of time. We were lucky to get a table for two when we asked at 10:15 am. There was only one table available, and was at 11:30 am. Be sure to appreciate the light show on the dark floor as you walk out of the restaurant: goldfish “swimming” with life-like motion, projected on the floor in front of you. We recommend The Eight for a good Cantonese meal and a fun overall experience."
2261,docchappy,Ballarat,Australia,6-July-2014,"We had the chefs menu on the advise of the staff as there was only 2 of us. We had desired suckling pig but it would have been way too much for us. The food was delicious particularly the crab claw , beef and the sesame dessert was to die for. Some of the textures and tastes were challenging to a western palate but it was all still good. We found the staff amazing; friendly , incredibly professional and they all worked as a well polished team. Small subtleties like just slipping in a knife n fork when they could see I struggled with the crab claw and chopsticks highlight why they have stars. Highly recommended"
2262,emyl0909,Hong Kong,None,3-July-2014,"This is the best Chinese restuarant in Macau in terms of the food they offered. However, the service is slow and the girls are forgetful. Not saying that they are not nice or impolite but they just keep forgetting things, forget to place order, forget to give you water, leave your dish at somewhere without serving it to you until you remind them."
2263,Greg Y,None,None,29-June-2014,"Don't get frightened from prices of the top dishes. There are lots of dishes with reasonable prices and they are amazing!"
2264,Eve C,Fengyuan,Taichung,2-June-2014,"we went at lunch time. early start 11:30am and promised to return the table by 1pm which is fine with us.

the place was decorated to be like a Chinese palace. The waitress wore beautiful cheungsam. All appeared to be very neat and luxurious. Their dim sum are most in the shape of gold fish or porcupine. Some are really delicious some are less. But the tea was disappointing. Tasteless.

They offer free starter and desert which are really yummy not to be missed. Lunch cost around US$ 40 for two. Reasonable for a three star. But not likely to revisit. Nothing really stands out that much."
2265,IHoHK,None,None,27-May-2014,"The entrance gives you a feeling of entering into water, and the design of dining is nice. Excellent service and food. You must try the dim sum recommended. Goldfish-shaped shrimp dumpling, pig-shaped roast pork bun, 紅棗馬拉糕，炒米粉，really excellent."
2266,clemc,colorado,None,26-May-2014,"This place is a Michelin Starred restaurant so the expectation was higher than normal. Overall, it was a good experience, excellent food and attentive service, but there are some hits and misses.

The hits were the food. I like the roasted suckling pig stuffed with rice. The pig skin was super crispy and the meat was relatively lean. The xiao lung bao were very tasty too. While the char siu bao were also very good, they were made into the form of a mice with white fur. I am not sure why the chef thinks putting a mice looking thing into your mouth is appetizing. The Portuguese egg tart and the milk tea they served at the end of the meal were excellent.

The misses were the service. First of all, every couple minutes a random waitress would come by and top up our tea. This may seem good service but the problem is the tea cups that they use is bigger than normal, the tea becomes cold very quickly so we were pretty much drinking cold tea more or less the whole time. We asked for some chili paste for our fried noodles which should be fairly common in a Chinese restaurant but in this case, we had to ask 4 waitresses and waited 15 minutes before one of them brought it. I mentioned the stuffed roasted pig was good but it took time to prepare so we ended up had to wait more than 15 min for it after we finished all the other dishes."
2267,Stephen S,Monaco-Ville,Monaco,29-April-2014,"Macau honestly is a smokey dirty city with few attractions aside from gambling. Even the PRC limits the visas to 6 per year or the city will be flooded with gambling smoking Chinese.
The Eight was a real surprise. It is in the Grande Lisboa Hotel and simply put is the best Cantomese food I have ever eaten. We started with BBQ'd smoked pork ribs, perfectly done, them prawns with pepers and chilis, excellent and ended with the chef's signature dish Lobster Cantonese. where the lobster is out of the shell and perfectly prepared 900 gms for the two of us. Ended with pomolo desert and a custard tart, Hey it is Macau. The ambiance was superb and you walk in over a brighe with goldfish swimming below you albeit a video very impressive. If you are in Macau it is a destination restaurant"
2268,skjean,None,None,27-April-2014,"The 8 had Best Visual, taste and services. I and My friend spended HKD800(Include tips) for Sunday Brunch, we were so happy for the quality of food and their services. Just I want to say,  Go, have seat and taste the flavors!!! "
2269,pipi_bean,Montreux,Switzerland,27-April-2014,"Was here for my mum's birthday dinner, I sent email to reserve a table and inform them it's for birthday dinner. I expected to have some nice arrangement yet there is nothing special unless I asked them before my arrival if they have any cakes to pre-order for the birthday as I expected to have  sth  from this Michelin star rest.

I really love the deco & atmosphere, especially the design of the whole restaurant. But I doubt why The Eight is Michelin star as dishes not really outstanding as a Michelin, and the presentation of the dishes are so-so, even tho the service & deco are great. Overall I can say this is a Michelin star with reasonable price, with great service but there is still a lot of improvement to become a real Michelin."
2270,pepoa2012,Quezon City,Philippines,22-March-2014,"We wanted very much to try their famous dumplings but they were full when we tried to walk in. We've tried booking through our hotel thrice but they were always fully booked although we were there for three weekdays.

Rating based on reviews and because I can't post without rating."
2271,Katyushan,None,None,1-March-2014,"I visited the restaurant on a business dinner with 30 of my colleagues. We were seated in private rooms and had a pre-arranged menu. Food is the feast of senses, so visually the surroundings are as important. I must say, however, that the private rooms were somewhat gloomy and the decoration was by far inferior to the common area. The service was a bit on the slow side with less than adequate English. I haven't seen the full menu of the restaurant as ours was pre-arranged yet, there was too much pork in it too my taste. The presentation of the dishes could be improved as Michelin star restaurants do pay attention both to how the food is served as well as how it tastes. Overall, unimpressed. Might be a good Chinese restaurant but did not feel like it was a Michelin star one."
2272,sakars,None,None,28-February-2014,"Cozy private dinning rooms, presentation excellent, staff courteous and energetic to help.... very exclusive destination !!"
2273,bobbyduong,Long Beach,California,20-January-2014,"Not to discredit other fantastic places in Asia or the places we ate in Hong Kong but The Eight lives up to its reputation.

It was our second day in Macau and we wanted to start the day off with something nice. Our friends recommended this place and we though we should give it a try - mind you not, we had really good dim sum in Hong Kong so we have high expectation. The decor, food and service was impeccable.

Decor - it is Macau after all so most places have a  Vegas-esque  design to it so we don't mind the over the top decor. Compared to other places, The Eight is a lot classier and less gaudy.

Food - loved everything we ordered. The dumplings were light as air and you can taste the skills and craftmanship put into it. The stir-fry broccoli with raisins and dry apricots is superb. Everything were individually served on a silver dim sum steamer and beautiful ceramic dishes.

Service - all the staffs were very nice and attentive.

I would recommend this to anyone who is planning to Macau. You won't be disappointed."

However, the taste is nothing spectacular and is comparable to other fine dining dim sim restaurants in Singapore. Service was good and staff were friendly and attentive. Free wifi was also available with password provided upon request."

Need to book in advance as we were not able to get a table for dinner for the next 2 days when we tried to reserve one after our enjoyable lunch."
2280,GOCHECK123,Keelung,Taiwan,24-November-2013,"Read great reviews about this restaurant and so we decided to give it a try on our trip to Macao. I made a reservation for dinner through online reservation system. Then i received an email saying they would call me to confirm before two days of my reserved date. On the date, i realized they haven't call me, so i sent them an email to say i have not got their call. Then they replied if i had any questions, i should contacted with them directly. This was the first bad impression. So i called to confirm my table.

We ordered few dishes and the rice was supposed to serve when the dish was served. But no, the rice was only served after two dished were served. The final dish came really slow. We had to wait for it. We could also heard staff chatting. I believe there is a need to enhance the service part.

I was taught not to leave the trace of moving the food in a dish plate by my grandmom. Actually this is basic presentation technique and manner in any non star restaurants in my country. I was extremely surprised to see the trace of sliding the duck liver in the plate. It was just not acceptable, especially in a two star restaurant i think.

Just thought this one is over rated in terms of service and food."
2281,ChocChocChip,None,None,23-November-2013,"Best restaurant in Macau...a must try...love the yummy food. Excellent service. Must not miss the suckling pig with rice, Peking duck, crackling pork, egg white with crab meat."
2282,Mal_MarcoPolo,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,15-November-2013,"Stayed at Grand Lisboa last week and visited this Michelin 2 Stars restaurant for lunch.

I'm a Chinese and have tasted all the dim sum around the world and I would have to say this is definitely one of the best.

Not only the ingredients are fresh, the tastes are pretty exotic, the chef has also put in lots of effort to make each pieces of dim sum looks artistic too.

Yes, the price is a bit steep but they give you surprises like free starters and desserts and the service level is excellent too.

Big thumb up !"
2283,WongWF,Singapore,Singapore,28-October-2013,"Located in Grand Lisboa, the Eight is one of the must-try in Macau. The dim sum selection is great. In addition, their food not only looks good, it tastes excellent. I now proudly declare that the best dim sum is in Macau.

Apart from dim sum, I strongly recommend the suckling pig baked rice which requires pre-order. The dish is so fragrant when brought to the table. Never tasted anything so good before."
2284,Aarmann M,None,None,11-October-2013,"One of my favourites! Cute dim-sum, great service, great atmosphere, great toilets, practically everything was great."
2285,GouGouH,Tokyo,Japan,17-September-2013,"I went there for Dim Sim, absolutely beaufiful !! They were so nicely done, the prawns dumplings and the pork bun were the best. The atmosphere was comfortable, not really long like other chinese restaurants. The services were appropriate. And the little gold fishes, nice. Great value for money too."
2286,love2review1234,Auckland,New Zealand,7-September-2013,"We went to The Eight quite late in the evening after a show as friends of ours from HK recommended it to us. To get to it you need to walk through the Grand Lisboa, which can get very confusing if you are trying to get directions in english. Because we were late we had the whole place to ourselves, which made the experience even better i suppose. The decor of the place was great, every little detail of it was well thought out. The service was absolutely top class, the maitre d, Luigi approached us and offered help with planning out menu for the evening, which we left for to him to organise (I HIGHLY recommend that you ask for this if you are willing to be more adventurous and experience more authentic food). Every dish was absolutely spectacular - I wish I could say what they were called though, but since he sorted it for us I have no idea haha.
Moreover, because of the fantastic service and decor of the place, we expected it to be very pricey - but we were pleasantly surprised when the bill arrived and it wasn't much more than we would spend in an average restaurant.

Over all, the Eight was one of the highlight of our Macau trip. I recommend it highly."
2287,henyberry,None,None,2-September-2013,"Best dimsum in town!! If you come to macau you must try this 8 restaurant, the presentation of the dimsum is full of art..service is good.. the price is reasonable and they give small welcome food and mini egg tart for dessert as complimentary!! The egg tart is so yummyy.. love this restaurant! Will come back next time.."
2288,Harryip,None,None,4-August-2013,"Macau is well known for good food and I had tried a lot of good restaurants here, but I have to say this restaurant really impressed me a lot. Escaped from the crowd of tourists with nice seating. Excellent food and wine selection."
2289,NMJK,Edmonton,Canada,1-August-2013,"There are many casinos in Macau so every hotel and restaurant has to come up with a theme or specialty to attract the customers. The Eight is worth going just to see the effort this Michelin-rated restaurant has put in to impress you. We went for dim sum and ordered a variety of carefully sculptured food that were really too nice to eat. This would include red bean cake (shape of 3 inch tall penguins), crab cake (shape of crab made with flaky pastry), shrimp dumplings (shape of gold fish); BBQ pork bun (porcupine); sherbet ice cream and pastry (bird sitting on nest). Bring your camera or cell phone, you will be taking pictures to impress your friends."
2290,dazzlingdivatw,Taipei,None,23-July-2013,"This was the 2nd time that we visited The Eight for dim sum. I would have to say that the dim sum menu is extensive and creative. They make the goldfish shaped shrimp dumpling and goldfish mango puddings. One of my favorite was the abalone pastry which was very tasty. Anyway, if anyone who likes dim sum will certainly enjoy the Eight."
2291,Heppy08,None,None,18-July-2013,"We went there for dinner. The whole experience from the amotsphere, service and food was amazing. Its certainly deserved of its michelin stars. All the dishes we had from the suckling pig, beef, chicken and fried rice were awesome. I would definitely be back again."
2292,chrissiij,None,None,1-July-2013,"We ate here, as we had read good reviews online and thought we should give it a go. However, we were very hungry and ordered a lot of food. A LOT! My first course to appear was pork belly in a guava sauce. This dish was divine. Crispy, melt in the mouth, juicy, fruity.......I could not get enough. I thought that nothing could top this. Then my second dish, Yunnan ham topped with mashed potato, came out. My goodness! The ham was sweet, succulent and absolutely beautiful. This was offset wonderfully by a creamy mashed potato.

I should have stopped there. My third course was a disaster. I had the pan-fried beef fillet with almonds. It really was not to my taste at all, as there was some chewy fat on it, but I can see how people would really enjoy it. Also, there was a bit too much almond on it for me - it over-powered the beef. All in all, though, a very good meal."
2293,Ines W,None,None,19-June-2013,"I love the dishes there...The dumplings, the steam eggs wth crab and their desert is very good. I'll definitely visit there again..."
2294,paneraitraveller,Singapore,Singapore,27-May-2013,"I love dimsum, and I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered 8 at Grand Lisboa (thanks to all the tripadvisor reviews). The dimsum was delightfully presented. At first glance, I was concerned that it may just be good presentation and nothing more. But a bite later of each item proved me wrong. Every item was simply delicious, freshly made. The service was very good too. I loved the food and service so much that I went back again the next day. The interior decor was a bit over the top, but it's in the Grand Lisboa and it's Macau. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and a new favourite dimsum restaurant for me."
2295,K8NSH,Blakesley,United Kingdom,24-February-2013,"Went for lunch on Sunday for dim sum. We had steamed shrimp, which arrived in the shape of goldfish, very cute, pork buns which looked like hedgehogs, a shrimp rice wrapped roll, crab tartlets (amazing), Vietnamese spring rolls and taro shrimp. The only thing I didn't like was the taro shrimp but that was just because it wasn't to my taste. The service was great and the restaurant atmosphere fabulous. Will definitely return - for the food we ate I would have expected the bill to be massive but it was very reasonable - $330 for lunch for 2."
2296,P0RTUGAL_Pedro,Obidos,Portugal,13-February-2013,"The Eight is still the best Chinese restaurant experience i had in Macau.
Perfect service, amazing atmosphere
You get completely involved when the doors open for you and the fishes start following your steps. You feel like
The food is the best of all.
I recommend lunch to have the dim sum.

A Real Chinese Fine dinning Experience."

This is one of my favorite dinning spot in the city...If you would like to have Chinese food during the stay, this is one of the best choice..."
2298,Nerite,Singapore,Singapore,19-December-2012,"Suprisingly not exhorbiant price given the nice food. Must tries are the cheong fun, har kau and congee. 6 of us costs $1300 MOP and we over ordered. The dessert menu not very appealing but they serve you egg tarts and milk tea complimentary. Wifi available at this place also so you can tell your friends how nice the food is! Do not forget to make a reservation prior!"

Dinner price is fair. You get more than what you pay. Give a try if you would like to have Chinese food during the stay. I love the desserts at The 8. Must try them all. Will giving you a whole new experience of Chinese dinning. Service used to be well couple years ago, getting worst but who cares, i'm here for the food."
2300,CCW75,London,None,9-December-2012,"I went there with a group and had our private room. I was quite impressed by the interior - images of moving goldfish underneath your feet when you enter the restaurant, wow!

The bottom line is, the most important thing for me when it comes to restaurants is the food. I am not 20 anymore and I don't care so much about being impressed. Frankly, nobody is interested in impressing me anymore in any event.

The skin of the suckling pig was thick and hard. I suspect they might have used an adult pig instead. The prawns came with mayonnaise and pumpkin sauce... interesting combination, but I couldn't force myself to get a second helping. The lamb was ok, but every else was quite mediocre, so much so that I don't remember much of it. The desert was like the mango jello that I make (this is not a compliment to myself).

Don't go if you are Chinese."
2301,Dale C,Melbourne,Australia,10-October-2012,"We had lunch at The 8 restaurant. There was a choice of a la carte or dim sum menus. We chose dim sum and apart from the bottomless teapot of jasmine tea, we had 6  courses , plus the best dessert of all time; try the chilled mango and coconut pudding in the shape of 2 golden fish. It is a very popular restaurant, and we were lucky to be there at 11.30 am to get a nice table."

Love the ambiance of the restaurant - very stylish and elegant with the large silk-embroidered koi on the walls and interesting water features in the entrance hallway. Subdued lighting and great service. Sometimes you have to choose between great food and atmosphere. In this Grand Lisboa restaurant you can have it all!! The Eight has two Michelin stars which speaks for itself and yes, it is more expensive."

2307,monique l,Moorpark,California,16-March-2012,"We had dinner there during our visit to Macau. It's located inside the Grand Lisboa. The entrance to the restaurant is amazing; it seems that gold fish are swimming below your feet and the two sides of wall seem having a cascade of water running down. We were seated at the best table of the restaurant with gold fish embroideries behind. Those embroideries are so beautifully stitched. We ordered roasted squab, grilled chicken with foie gras, green vegetable, deboned shredded chicken mixed with pomelo and citrus juice with crispy chicken skin on top (highly recommend this dish), steamed crab claws, and finally a dessert with the form of three small pears. Half cup of complimentary Hong Kong style milk tea and a small piece of cake at the end to complete the dinner. The total cost was only half what you would pay for the same dishes ordered in Hong Kong. Servers were attentive and very helpful but the restaurant was a little noisy that evening with some guests in the other side of the dining area."
2308,P G,Toronto,ON,20-November-2011,"I went to this restaurant for dinner, not for dim sum like other reviewers, therefore this review is only applicable to the dinner menu. The food was pretty good and fairly authentic. It is also a beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. However, for the price you are paying, the food should be better and the portions larger. For example, one of our fish dishes was really overcooked and we ordered  spicy beef  which was actually on the sweet side, not at all spicy. I think there are better places to spend your money in Macau."
2309,babywine,Macau,None,26-August-2011,"This place is probably the best dim sum restaurant in macau.
The dishes are all superbly and creatively presented, and the usual dim sums are all very fresh and some have little added twists.
Definitely the place to impress corporate execs but still reasonably good value for families.
Dinner is a different proposition though as the prices rocket up.
Go for dim sum!"

Broadway was a new experience for us but we were staying at Galaxy Hotel so only a few minutes across the walk bridge. Food Street is a great little addition to the wonderful Galaxy hotel. Definitely worth a visit."

Luckily I managed to find THW broadway before back to Indonesia"

I am not really a fan of Chinese food but lucky i gave it a try. I love their pork dumpling with shrimp and their char siew. The pork bun is really tasty and it's my favorite now. This was my first time to eat in Tim Ho Wan although we have this in Singapore and I will definitely dine again. The price is cheap!"
2330,bmcburn,None,None,4-February-2017,"Went to Tim Ho Wan for Dim Sum. The restaurant was very busy but only had to wait around five minutes for a table. Took around 15 mins for the food to arrive. Food quality was similar to other Dim Sum restaurants."

2332,mentanour,None,None,31-December-2016,"We came here for late lunch. This is supposedly to be a Michelin One Star Restaurant but the I didn't find anything special with their dim sum. We ordered Baked Bun with BBQ Pork, Pan Fried Turnip Cake, Fried Noodle with Soy Sauce, Rice with Beef & Fried Egg, and Prawn Dumpling. Pretty average indeed."
2333,SophiaKuo,None,None,22-November-2016,"It was lunch time when I went there. This restaurant it’s popular so you can see there are many people and you need to line up so that you can get the desk. I went here with my friends. Actually it’s a Hong Kong restaurant. But if you didn’t have any time to go HK then Tim Ho Wan in Macau. Walk along Broadway can be seen Tim good luck, Tim good luck addition to the location of obvious at the corner, white and green signs are also very eye-catching, through the passing, will not let you miss! Although there are many sittings, it’s not significantly crowded, the overall elegant and comfortable to the dining atmosphere. The thing I want to recommend is call barbecued pork bread. Crisp and fragrant crisp bite, the hollow barbecue pork bread filled with pork and baked pork, salty sweet aroma attractive, there are a lot of barbecued pork, in addition to delicious is real material.
I highly recommend this restaurant."
2334,Sahlee S,None,None,31-October-2016,"Recommended by a friend, after trying it myself it's never to missed when you are in Macau,Broadway..I promised. Super yummy on every bite"
2335,Amy_SF_USA,San Mateo,California,26-September-2016,"If you crave dim sum at dinner time this place will fill your needs. The original restaurant in Hong Kong received a Michelin star so they opened additional locations with the same name. This is my first time here and while the food is fine, I am not sure exactly how this restaurant got its Michelin star. Maybe the one in HK is better."
2336,Kanku9,Melbourne,None,12-September-2016,"Tim Ho Wan made good dim sum, no doubt about it. But is that the kind of restaurant which warrants queuing for hours to get a table? I doubt about it. Melbourne Australia has many great dim sum restaurants which are on par with Tim Ho Wan. The range of dishes is not impressively great. You find most of them in other dim sum restaurants. The special dishes worth a try are the delicious Baked Bun with BBQ Pork and the beautiful Mango Sago Pomelo dessert. *** Direction - catch the casinos free shuttle bus and get off at Broadway Casio. Some listing has it at Galaxy, but Galaxy hotel/casino complex is huge. If you get dropped off at the wrong end, you may end up walking 10-15' to get to the other end."
2337,Jayson C,New York,None,28-August-2016,"Dim Sum open at 10 am , for hard core elders I am sure they want to go Dim Sum at 9am or even earlier. In general I had a 10 minutes wait at 10 am and was seated quickly for our group of 8. The dim sum was above average. I recommend the Steam Egg Cake & the Vermicelli Roll. The abalone puff was good , but I have had better at Pak Loh Chiu Chow in Hong Kong. In general all the dim sum was tasty and good/above average. I would definitely go back here next time in Macau!"
2338,skornp,Nonthaburi,Thailand,26-August-2016,"My friend and I planed to have Dim Sum at Tim Ho Wan and we did it finally. Fortunately, we went to Macau by Air Macau which our boarding passes could redeem for dining vouchers at being used here. Baked Bar B Q Pork Bun is a signature here. Reasonable price, taste and service good, and Must Try if you like Dim Sum."
2339,Bethchabay,Macau,None,27-July-2016,"We eat there as family. My son loves their siomai and their bun with barbequed pork. The place is nice and neat. It is located in the Broadway food street at the back of Galaxy Hotel. The price is quite fair it's at par to the outside dim sum houses that you would see around Macau."
2340,Punsri21,Bangkok,Thailand,2-March-2016,"The restaurant is the first on the entrance of Broadway food street. I have tried the one in Hongkong which so many queues to wait to get in but here is easier without queuing. The quality of food is almost the same. Not many foods offer but all are great. I quite enjoy rice roll and bun. But other is all good. So this restaurant is highly recommended."
2341,planetbackpacker,Macau,None,11-January-2016,"Came here with some colleagues for a dim sum lunch and was surprised to see so many people waiting outside for a table.  The place must be good,  I thought. But I should have noticed the decor while I was waiting. If I had seen the stools that most people were sitting on and noticed the aluminum flasks in which the  tea  was served, I would have skipped this place altogether. I mean, there are days when I crave McDonald's, but usually when I feel like yum-cha-ing (literally meaning tea drinking), I prefer to be able to choose my tea and sit back to relax while I wait for the dim sum to come. Quality-wise, the food was just so-so. The restaurant focuses on a few signature items rather than offer an extensive menu, which is a smart move as I get the sense that all of the items on offer are massively produced somewhere else.

So if you are craving for some dim sum fast food and don't mind waiting for a table (which kind of defeats one of the purposes of eating fast food), Tim Ho Wan is the place for you."

You will receive a number for the amount of seats you want and have to wait until it is your turn. Don't be scared of how many people are waiting, this is an eat&go restaurant, so people will leave as soon as they are finished eating.

2404,Joycelcp,None,None,22-September-2019,"I tried 3 items from the shop and I must say all of them are up to standard . The price isn’t cheap but If just comparing within Macau tourist area .. i think it’s reasonable and not considered expensive

1) Pork Cutlet Bun
I rank this the highest of the 3 since this is a Macau dish and I have tried from a few places in Macau to compare . The bun is hot and crispy .. pork cutlet is juicy , tasty and tender . Imo if u are trying a pork cutlet bun for the first time .. u can def try it here . I will come back again for the pork cutlet bun for sure .

2) Shrimp Wonton Soup
The seafood broth is rich and tasty . Wonton is sizable and the prawn inside is really fresh. The standard is definitely restaurant standard . That said , it’s not something that will blow ur mind away simply because if u do visit any good standard restaurant in Asia , you might get the same . Nevertheless , that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a good bowl of shrimp wonton

3) Crab Congee
My first mouth of congee was a bit disappointing because I found it rather bland . However , as I continue to dig into this dish, I started to appreciate the sweet flavour of the crab in the congee . If u are someone who likes v salty and strong flavoured food- you may not appreciate this dish as much . As the congee cools , the flavour gets stronger and better . Very sizable portion ( though the crab isn’t v big) and the crab is extremely fresh . * prepare to get ur hands dirty as u will need to plow thru the crab duh!

I don’t have any issues with the service. Staff is pleasant , they were quick to take my order , refilled my tea without asking . I won’t give them service awards but they are def ok .

I went to the restaurant at around 1pm and waited for abt 15 mins , 1pax ."

To have such a nasty woman as the person greeting your customers shows how little this restaurant values people's custom.

The noodle was even more disappointing, being clumped together and not having the same  bounce  as the good won ton noodles of the traditional Canton. However, the won tons were very flavorful and tasty. But one out of three does not make a good bowl of won ton noodle soup as all three must blend together in order for it to work.

The restaurant span 3 storey high, we are being alocated and 7 person squeeze into 1 table. The food menu is quite expensive and I have ordered a bowl of dry wanton. The serving is not that fast partly due to the large crowd, they are using dumb waiter to send the food from level 1 to level 2 for ease of walking the stair. To be frank I am not a fan of HK wanton mee, so I don't really like the noodle or the soup given, but my other colleagues prefer the springy noodle though.

Love the rest of the food and is highly recommended!"
2415,catalin s,Craiova,Romania,17-July-2018,"The place is a bit hard to find, behind the columns in Largo do Senado. Small, cozy place, it's hard to believe it is spread along three levels (street, basement, first floor). We managed to find the only available table, at ten in the morning.
Food was very tasty, we had some Cantonese noodle dishes plus an incredible pork sandwich (probably a Portuguese heritage), coffee, tea. Prices ok.
They don't speak a lot of English and it was so funny trying to order and communicate with the staff. Staff super ok, very attentive. We paid in cash, I just can't remember if they take cards."

LOCATION

Strategically located in the epicenter of the Macau CBD (Central Busy District), sits this famous traditional noodle and congee restaurant.

ENVIRONMENT

Adopting the historic Chinese tea house architecture with wooden interiors and furniture, the lattice design is intricate and appropriate. In keeping with the Five Elements Theory used in fengshui (geomancy), the screenwall and windows display distinct wooden geometric lattice-work designs.

FOOD

Famous Shrimp roe wonton noodle using bamboo stick to compress the noodles and congee was a happy tourist meal at the right time, but not worthy of a special trip.

SERVICE

Quick and efficient!

Author not foodie blogger, but cuisine seems reasonably tasteful and priced. Of course not easy for any dish to suit all tastes."
2418,SGPTaiTai,Singapore,Singapore,17-March-2018,"I agree with other reviews regarding the signature dry shrimp roe noodles: it was too dry and we had to add chilli oil and some soup to give it better texture.

As for the shrimp dumplings, they were tasty but given that it isn't hard to find the same standard of dumplings in Hong Kong or Singapore, it wasn't worth the wait or crowd."
2419,KeiHongC1,None,None,26-February-2018,"It really kept the traditional taste of Macau and Guangdong food. The beef stew and wet fried pork noodles are superb. The steam rice with shrimp paste is also a good one."
2420,xAZAMBx,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,10-February-2018,"Shrimp roe noodles and its wonton soup were incredibly delicious!! But the crab congee (porridge) were disappointing even though it was highly recommended. All 3 costs about MOP 230 which were reasonable compared to other restaurants (Macau restaurants are expensive - lower your expectation).

There were many people, so we had to share our tables with 2 other strangers."
2421,Karis S,None,None,29-January-2018,"Second time eating and food is good as usual. Popular for dried shrimp noodle but too dry and noodle too hard for my taste. Wanton and dumpling ingredient is fresh and crunchy and the fried rice is tasty. Highly recommended and worth the wait!"
2422,Howyong,Batu Pahat,Malaysia,29-December-2017,"Crowded but Serve food very fast. It is a eat-N-go type, if you stay too Long you will get 3 different group of people sharing your table. Definitely not a place for romantic meal.

The signature  Har Chi  Noodle was too dried by nature, it could stuck in your throat, $75 per plate is a bit pricey, not a fan. Go for the normal Wan Tan noodle.

Do not expect any service here, you are lucky if the waitress doesn't scold you, decide what you want fast, they don't even border to ask us what we want to drink, gave us 2 cups of Chinese tea with oil floating on them. Too crowded so the service & quality of food have compromised."
2423,Cekeysh,Jakarta,Indonesia,11-December-2017,"They provides various menus of noodles, fried noodles, with chicken, seafood or mushroom. The taste is great and the portion is overwhelming. People will need to take a number and wait in the queue each time of visit, as the number of tables is limited. But they are professional and not letting people hang out too long after each dine."
2424,Naajaanaajaa,Bangkok,Thailand,8-December-2017,"I have visited this restaurant in November when I visited Senado Square. I ordered egg noodle. It was very dilicious. I tried abalone congee and the taste was great. Fried wonton was good for kids. See photoes on what I ate. It is recommended to try once."
2425,thetravelingmaster,Medan,Indonesia,3-December-2017,"Located at Senado Square, this eating place serves mostly chinese food. I ordered a bowl of wonton noodle, and another bowl of spicy one, and they were wonderful. I also ordered a glass of red bean drink. The bill came to HKD 109, which I had no idea whether it's properly priced. Yet, I wanna come back here if I happen to visit Macao again. The only downside is the staff here appear to be difficult to smile."
2426,rifkaamelia,Jakarta,Indonesia,10-September-2017,"Almost all of the food we had here are delicious we ended up coming back few times. Love the al dente shrimp roe noodle.

Although it's well known and has been around for tens of years, we found the congee and noodles to be mediocre, nothing special. It has a basement seating area which is very small and the staff are less than friendly."

Love their shrimp roe noodle although price is bit costly at MOP75. I also tried their delicious fish ball.

Satisfying meal I'd say. Recommended."
2433,anam351,Brussels,Belgium,1-June-2017,"I went to this restaurant considering its review at trip advisor and I didn't regret at all. The fish balls are awesome and the location is perfect. I just would consider as a negative point the fact that they don't have card payment available which is a little strange."

Ordered a bowl of wanton noodles, the noodles sticks to each other and were a bit stiff to bite. Had to toss the noodles a few times in the soup to further soften the noodles. The wanton were not bad, but the noodles probably need some improvement."
2438,wshapr,Melaka,Malaysia,29-March-2017,"It was a rainy Sunday morning and Send Square were full of people. Initially, we wanted to walk further for other famous eateries but, due to the rain, we decided to have our brunch in this restaurant. It was full of people and we were leaded to 3rd floor and sharing table with others. I had very delicious and crispy pork burger and quite satisfied with it. I am not sure whether it is their local cultural that mostly other tables never ordered drinks except us. The rest of the food is average."
2439,790angelinaa,Singapore,Singapore,13-March-2017,"Visited on 07/03/2017,was very crowded,we climbed to the third floor. We ordered Wanton noodle,noodle is fine and is tasty. I ordered dry noodle,eventhough,it didn't added any sauce but is tasty,the water dumpling is tasty too. We like it very much. Cannot remember how much but is quite pricey but think is worth it. Service wise,maybe is just one crew taking orders so need to wait."
2440,LeowJason,None,None,26-February-2017,"We walked past this restaurant on the way back to Hotel Royal and was attracted to the noodles that were sprinkled with dried blended prawn powder, the noodles were not spongy as we always get in Macau. Service was not good as well."
2441,calidomca,Orange County,California,23-February-2017,"Amazingly tasty food, until we found hair in two of our dishes.
The wonton is fresh, the broth is tasty, the shrimp filling is big, fresh and sweet.
The noodles were al dente and thin.
The crab congee is smaller than What they show on the menu, it's tasty, but there weren't much inside.
The waitress told us it's normal to have hair in the food, because it happens when you are cooking.
I rarely see hair in my food, so I don't know what is she talking about. She is willing to give us a small discount for the hairy porridge. Are you kidding me?
In the end, she cancelled the congee with an obviously not so happy face.

5 stars to the taste and the quality of the food.
3 stars to the friendly waitress
0 star to the manager service
0 star to their unhygienic food

Will I still go back to this place?
No... but I can always go to their other franchise. After all, they do provide yummy food"
2442,708wernerw,Zurich,Switzerland,22-February-2017,"The food was ok but not more than average. the noodles would be much better if they would use not that much oil to prepare. There was also some meat but not much. The spices also were not extraordinary and the service unfriendly. They have enough tourists coming to the place."
2443,Yong Kian T,Singapore,Singapore,8-January-2017,"Wong Chi Kei Restaurant is on my list of food places to try in Macau, and it didn't disappoint as the noodles tasted great! Not only that, I liked the vegetables and fried wonton too. The prices are a little higher but it's well worth it. It is also very popular with the tourists so expect long queues if you're with groups of 4 and above."
2444,cpr2exs,None,None,8-January-2017,"There's a long queue for this place. Tip - take a number and go wandering around Senado Square. Had their fried wontons which are enormous. The porridge and noodles are very good too. Highly recommended - we paid MOP600 for 9 people."
2445,hanpinn,Singapore,Singapore,4-January-2017,"This branch has a second storey. These are some of the dishes we ordered. The noodles are one of the tastiest I've ever eaten.. they are very thin and soft but at the same time spongy enough for you to feel some texture in it.. we enjoyed it so much that we bought some dried ones so that we could bring home to cook. Highly recommended!"
2446,alvinashultz,Singapore,Singapore,2-January-2017,"Had lunch here, it was packed. Took us about 20mins to get a table for 4. The service here is not friendly, especially so if you can't speak chinese or cantonese. The wantons were average, you can probably get better ones in Hongkong, slightly overpriced. The dry noodles were slightly too dry for my liking, although i liked how thin the noodles were."
2447,Kbhuat,None,None,23-December-2016,"Had dinner with my family at this restaurant. The wan tan or won ton noodles were just average, certainly not as good as those in Hong Kong. However the kai lan vegetables were suprisingly good. Price was reasonable and value for money."
2448,Rinzilla,Bangkok,Thailand,15-December-2016,"I had lunch here every time I visited Macao. The place always be full, so you should expect to wait a while.

Recommended food for me is: noodle with soup, wanton, stir fried noodle. The congee is famous as well but I quite don't like it.

The restaurant is famous for its wan ton noodles which i ordered 2 for both my girlfriend and myself. The wan tons here are really worth a try because it's really delicious, the taste of the shrimps and the meat inside the wan tons were mixed so well together. However, one thing that kinda stopped me from ordering more was that it's a lot more expensive compared to the time when i was still a kid. But it's worth a try."

We went there on Sunday afternoon and had to wait for about an hour to get a table. Don't go there if you are extremely hungry. But once you've served, it's very fast and they are very professional."
2517,birdwithoutleg,None,None,4-September-2014,"Had breakfast at this same shop for 2 days because the porridge is simply too delicious, we have to come back for more. Personal favorite however is the dry shrimp noodle, 招牌虾子捞面, simple and tasty, noodle was not too dry and full of the taste of the shrimp eggs.
Porridge is a must try, we had 3 type of porridge, all taste delicious, mainly because the base is well cook, texture is smooth and savoury, only eating the plain porridge is satisfactory enough for me. Wanton is also another must try in the shop, with fresh and chewy big prawn wrap inside the wanton together with mince meat, it is one of the best wanton I tasted in Macau.

Price is a little bit on the high side though, if more people is going together will have a better chance of trying different dishes."
2518,Ursula L,Semarang,Indonesia,2-September-2014,"I came here because of online recommendations. Luckily, my sister and I arrived when the shop just opened their door for that day. It meant no many customers yet and we could get an empty table in no time. The service was average but fast. The noodles were average. But, the meat was tender so it was easy to chew."
2519,Thye L,None,None,2-September-2014,"Although, this shop is famous for the Wanton Noodles, however, I had a crab porridge instead. It's marvelous, the porridge is so smooth and the whole crab inside the porridge."
2520,Wendy W,Singapore,None,26-August-2014,"Very unassuming outlet - which I was told is the original flagship outlet at Senado Square. The outlet itself is not difficult to locate, just a few shops down from Watsons. Despite the long quenes, we did not have to wait too long for a table as the outlet itself is 3 storeys high.

Had their signature shrimp roe noodles - which is essentially dry noodles (lightly seasoned with soy sauce) with a generous amount of shrimp roe.

Looked deceptively plain but at 1st taste, it was so so so so good! Generous amount of shrimp roe + the noodles itself were really thin and springy (a sign that it was freshly & traditionally handmade using bamboo poles).

Had their famed crab porridge & fried wantons as well. But they simply do not measure up to the wow quality of the shrimp roe noodles :)"
2521,RunningManLolol,Singapore,Singapore,19-August-2014,"Came here after seeing the many positive reviews and recommendation online only to be greeted with disappointment. Queued for 15 min to get a table. After which, we ordered the house specialty noodles with shrimp roe and wanton. The noodles were very dry and was clumped together. Can't really taste the shrimp roe and the overall feeling was like as though I was chewing on rubber bands. Disappointing. Saw the patrons at the other tables having the congee which looked more appetizing. Perhaps should have tried that instead. Overall, not worth the effort to queue for a table. I believe we can easily get more authentic Macanese/Cantonese food elsewhere."
2522,Briyano,None,None,17-August-2014,"Average fare. Overhype. Good locality in senado square near ruins. Will rather dine in authentic hk/macau food stalls. Mediocre noodles. Crab porridge is decent though. Service standards can be better"
2523,Britishtraveller2014,Northampton,United Kingdom,5-August-2014,"If you want to experience a real 'local' food eatery without going down a side street, and with good location onto the square, go here!

We went here as we love noodle soup - we've had it all over Asia. The noodle soup here was very good, it did not disappoint. I had mine with BBQ duck and that was delicious. All of the noodle soups looked good, particularly the ones with wantons or prawns. Also, the couple next to us ordered rice with prawns and egg - which sounds weird but looked absolutely delicious and the egg was just part of the sauce. If I was to go back I would try this as I had a bit of food envy!

The great things about this place: The range of the menu, suitable for both international travelers and locals. The space inside - it just keeps going up, we were on the third floor, and downstairs it looked tiny! Also we were in a bit of a rush so the speed of the service suited us. However, our food did come out within 3-4mins of us ordering, which did surprise us and we did wonder if they had things just 'ready to go'! The veg we ordered separately was a lot longer and obviously freshly cooked.

I think the fact they served us so quickly and were running around could be seen as both a positive and a negative. They were busy and so I guess being extra efficient was in some way necessary. However, when we went there were no queues - though there were very few empty tables! But we definitely felt we shouldn't 'hang around' or have a another drink and relax - in fact we were presented with the bill before we even started eating!

Overall, it was a great local experience and I'm glad I went (although we did have to ignore half of the things on the menu e.g. 'pigs trotter - foreleg with hoof'!). Everyone else in there at the time we went seemed to be Chinese which is a sign that the food is obviously good as the locals like it too. If you want to sample a true local menu and eat within an extremely reasonable budget (our whole meal, with drinks was around £8!) then give this go, you will enjoy it! :)"
2524,C B,Jakarta,Indonesia,3-August-2014,"The wanton noodle is hands down the best I've had my entire life. The noodles are made using a special mixture of duck egg whites and flour (no water), and thus has a bouncy, fresh consistency. The wantons are made using extremely fresh ingredients, and there are massive shrimps in each one. Each bite of the wanton noodle is absolutely divine.

My foodie family came here for dinner, and came back again for breakfast the next day. It's that good!!! There're usually quite a crowd waiting for seats, but service is fast and efficient, so you normally won't need to wait too long (max 15 min).

One thing though - their veggies are a bit of a rip off. We ordered the kailan with oyster sauce, and was served six kailan stems with a few leaves. But all in all, you'd be missing out big time if you don't go for a visit. Noodles noodles noodles!!"
2525,ReccaHuang,Singapore,Singapore,22-July-2014,"Get a queue number and wait patiently. Noodles here are simply awesome and get the specialty, prawn roe noodles.

The noodles here are made Cantonese style using bamboo sticks & are very  springy  which I like. the wonton dry noodles are good, the congee is average."
2528,tanwl79,None,None,12-April-2014,"Convenient location. Located right at the heart of Senado Square. Noodles were cooked just right, springy without being overly firm.

2529,w p,Singapore,Singapore,5-April-2014,"Noting that people were raving over the shrimp roe noodles but knowing how popular food is usually overrated, I went with my gut and ordered the Ow Lam Meen instead - stir fried thin yellow noodles with beef brisket. It was delicious - I dare say the best meal of the trip. The portion was big enough for 2 people.

I also ordered Kai Lan with oyster sauce and the vegetables were extremely tender with the oyster sauce in a separate dish. I ended up not putting any oyster sauce at all as the vegetables were excellent as is.

The atmosphere there could be abit claustrophobic though as people are basically sitting next to each other's elbows."

2532,SarahYLTS,Singapore,Singapore,17-January-2014,"The braised noodle w/black mushrooms here are the best I've ever tasted and the mushrooms were very tender. Although the noodles were dry in nature, they were thin and springy and with just the right amount of sauce they added to it, it was a perfect taste. However, unless you are a lover of black mushrooms, the black mushroom flavour might be too strong and overwhelming.

The braised noodle w/wonton & shrimp's eggs were the worst I've ever tasted. The shrimp's eggs had a very strong plastic taste and the wontons were a tad bland.

The braised noodle with squid was very tasty with the squid being very fresh and tender. With a repeat order, there was hardly any sauce with the noodle and it was too dry to be tasty. With their reputation, Wong Chi Kei should be able to replicate the taste regardless of the number of servings ordered but that does not seem to be the case.

Also, if you wanted plain warm water, they would not serve it to you if you were seated in the basement. Was told I had to go upstairs to get it."

Very affordable for the area.

This place gets crowded during lunch time when everybody is sightseeing since it is located in Senado Square almost beside the Starbucks coffee shop. It easy to miss since the facade of the place is like an ordinary chinese shop.

I tried thier wonton noodles and wow...it was very filling! The taste is so much better than those I've tried before. My husband tried their fried rice mixed with beef, egg & vegetables and was shocked at the amount of serving on his plate.

Food prices range from MOP$40 ++"

Highly recommend this if you are looking for traditional Chinese cuisine especially Dim Sum"
2589,hlmh,Singapore,None,18-June-2016,"Situated in the expensive Sands Cotai Area, I would have thought the prices would be reflective as well. Surprisingly, it was quite reasonable. Just beware that the porridge is a big portion good for 3, so don't order one bowl per pax."

And the other side the big seafood wanton in broth was very well made, not too complex just plain good."

We will visit Yum Cha again for our next trip to Macau"
2593,PandaHouston,Houston,Texas,2-January-2016,"We were staying at the Conrad and Yum Cha was only a few minutes walk for us. They served good dim sum - not quite as good as some of the quality in Hong Kong but it did the trick for us after getting off the plane.

The prices are on the high side - probably because they are near the casinos.

Here are some of the items we ordered:

Cucumber in Black Vinegar 40 MOP
Chicken Feet 35 MOP
Bean Curd Sheet Roll 42 MOP
Shrimp Ha Gow 45 MOP"
2594,articulatemis,Sydney,Australia,28-December-2015,"We were fresh off the ferry, fresh into our hotel and starving for some yum cha of any kind. This place was an obvious choice, I mean it's literally called  yum cha  what could possibly go wrong? Anyway its more of an al a carte yum cha there's no typical trolley pushing servers. There's a menu of what they have, you tick the boxes you want and they just bring it out to you. Everything came out alright only they did forget one item we ordered, we forgot about it too until we saw the bill. It was removed and all was well. They gave us a post dining survey to fill out even. We were honest."

As what the previous reviewer has pointed out correctly, going breakfast before 9 is a mistake. The menu is limited with not much choices. The noodles I had for breakfast was mediocre. But what the porridge that my wife had was good. Siew mai and Char Siew bun were good too."
2600,Mayswchen,Singapore,Singapore,24-May-2015,"Don't ever go for breakfast before 9 am. The ala carte list is much less & of poor quality! We had to complained to the captain re at least 2 dishes that were not fit to be served.
And we were not the only diners that complained that morning.
Never order their Cheong Fun with XO sauce. First no XO sauce only light soya sauce. Secondly the dish was cold as they only microwaved it. Just imagine what we ate tasted cold and hard in the centre...
Also don't ever take their fried noodles...tasteless and bland. Waste of money indeed!
Lucky Captain nice enough to take it off our bill.
They do serve very nice set lunch & dinner for a reasonable price which we had no complaints about. Quality was good.
Yes, must emphasis service was slow & not so efficient."
2601,VAGypsyGirl,None,None,18-May-2015,"I was looking forward to a dim sum meal, but was disappointed by this place. The service is extremely slow. One of my dishes never came, so I had them cancel it. The dishes I had were good, but not impressive."

The food was fresh, delicious, tasty with good sized portions and arrived in good time. it was my husbands 50th birthday and I even showed his passport to the staff to verify this. A dessert with a candle or even a quick burst of Happy Birthday would have sufficed but there was nothing. The restaurant was not even busy at 10pm while we were there. I can only conclude that the staff are only used to serving food robotically and have no idea of how to liven up a birthday meal. This is a shame because everything else was perfect."
2603,LetsGoSightseeing,Noida,India,19-February-2015,"our holiday inn stay package gave us breakfast at yum cha. It had an Asian breakfast and lunch set menu wherein we had to select dishes. Out of the list, the dishes that seemed palatable to us were chicken Sui mai with mushroom, coriander-flavoured vegetarian dumplings, steamed bun, mini pineapple bun, assorted mushroom and shredded chicken with rice vermicelli in soup, vegetables noodles in soup, pan-fried rice roll with sesame sauce, fried noodles, regular coffee and English tea. Unfortunately, not all of them were edible. The servers had a hard time understanding English. We were so disappointed that for the next day, we got our breakfast upgraded to another restaurant by paying extra."
2604,Gl0beTrekka,Singapore,Singapore,2-January-2015,"This is your standard dim sum restaurant. The quality was pretty good, and there was a wide variety. The price was also pitched at the right level --- it was high enough to get sufficient quality, but low enough not to be expensive. And best of all the food was served quickly!
My real gripe and which is why it only gets an average rating is the service was terrible. Not attentive at all. We had to wave many staff down to get attention to order, and then we needed to go up to the counter to ask for the bill at the end of the meal.
Would I go back? For the fast food delivery, I would. For the service? Probably not."
2605,ESY222,None,None,1-December-2014,"good price but the food is so-so. you can taste the food additive very easily. we only finished 2 or 3 pieces from the dish of fried radish cube with XO sauce. the-suppose-to-be-crunchy layer is not crunchy but hard."
2606,Ogi0,Sofia,Bulgaria,1-September-2014,"We were staying at the Holiday Inn Cotai Central and twice had breakfast at Yum Cha. Кухнята е Dim Sum, без подправки и не е много вкусна. The biggest problem with the drinks - can be ordered coffee, tea or juice , but only one of these."
2607,670AnaV,Manila,None,26-July-2014,"Tried this restaurant for lunch with a friend and ordered the sweet sour pork, braised beef and yang chow rice. The pork turned out to be sweet sour pork balls, tasted good though. The beef in a pot with watery sauce was very tender but too much for 2 and I didn't like the presentation asit looked really bland and unappetizing. The rice was good but just enough for one person.

Bill was around MOP 430.

I wasn't that satisfied with my experience and would try the other Chinese restaurants nearby."
2608,Freedom1Oz,None,None,28-June-2014,"Great service and quality and Danny (manager) is outstanding and has set great service standards You must try"
2609,Frappezz,Asia,None,2-December-2013,"This restaurant enjoys brisk business as it is near the East Lobby where the shuttle service to Sands Cotai Central drops off and picks up passengers. Tables are arranged close enough for one to hear perfectly an on-going conversation at the next table. The wait staff is kept busy with a never ending stream of customers but that is no excuse for having customers beckon them a few times before they approach the table, serving the wrong type of tea and ignoring requests for serving spoons.

It is usually not easy to find badly executed dim sum in Hong Kong and Macau; most of the dim sum served at Yum Cha Restaurant pass muster. The steamed shrimp dumplings were plump and juicy, with thin pastry encasing fresh shrimps and finely minced bamboo shoots. The steamed pork dumplings with fish roe were well done too. However the dim sum's quality was a hit and miss affair, depending on what one orders. The steamed vegetarian dumplings (fun guo) had very thick pastry, the baked egg tartlets (darn tut) were heavy, without the fragrance of smooth egg custard and pastry shells that were too dry, while the soupy dumpling (tong gau) had coarse and thick pastry skin and broth that was too salty. If one orders the right items, a decent, no frills meal can be had here, but do not expect pleasant and efficient service."
2610,laodi,Singapore,None,12-September-2013,"I had breakfast here only because it is in the package I had for staying in Holiday Inn Cotai Central. Good thing is breakfast is from 7am until 2pm, but being  free , the portion is small. I can confirmed that the portion will be much bigger if I am a normal walk-in paying customer.

Customer service is normal, dim sum is not tasty, porriage is tasteless and waiting time is long. Well, I will go somewhere else if I am paying."

Food was decent enough, good Chinese dumplings but then some items took ages and none of the tables were cleared. So lots of tables with half eaten food around. Har gow and pork buns were good. Could be much better with an injection of effeciency and clean tables."

Quickly ordered some noodles and dim sum but most were not available.

Soup noodle was average but the roast pork was good.

Char Siew pau perfect

Fried spring roll with duck is something you need to try. I haven't seen this anywhere.

All ingredients were extra ordinary. Best quality to say the least!!

Chinese food is notorious for its use of msg. All flavors were balanced and i didn't feel thirsty after the meal.

One dish ruined it was the pan fried cuttlefish with the pepper and garlic spice? I forgot the name. The spice was perfect but the cuttlefish was not crisp. It felt like one day old cuttlefish. It just was up to expectation in a place like this.

The vegetable was cooked to perfection.

The service was impeccable.

A finer taste for chinese cuisine!!!

We also ordered the baked crab shell, prawn and scallops in XO sauce and our second dish of duck in lettuce leaves. And the signature fried rice. I would have to say the last duck dish I didn't enjoy as much as I found it quite dry and tasteless. And we ordered a lovely bottle of Pinot Noir from Marlborough.
