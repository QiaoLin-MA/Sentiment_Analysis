1,HKPANG,Ipoh,Malaysia,18-June-2017,"Old restaurant with average cleaniness. You have to order & pay at the front cashier. Just pick whatever you like (photos menu) behind that counter.
Frankly the soup was aromatic & not oily. My guess that the soup was made from boiling shrimp shells, pork bones and dried flounder to give it a distinct taste. Wontons were big & tasted better than most stores. Noodles were springly and without the strong alkaline after taste."
2,syangbr,Sao Paulo,SP,14-January-2016,"The place is very old and not very clean, opened for many decades, I started to eat there since 90´s when I was a kid and every time I return to China Guangzhou I must go there to eat. The soup that they use to cook the noodle is composed by many kinds of fish and seafood, very tasty, cooked for hours, it´s a must try! All foods, affordable prices."
3,Richard B,None,None,7-December-2019,"About 20 (all relatives) for lunch. Food very good in quantity and choice. Service efficient. About £10 per head. Good 4*. Recommended."
4,norwood3220,Vancouver,Canada,24-November-2019,"This restaurant is over-rated. They do not take reservation and so I arrived at 1045 just to ensure that I have not flown 10,000 km in vain and to be turned away, due to my limited days in Canton. The Michelin award was probably for the other dishes and since I was there for the dim sum , it was just ordinary.....so ordinary that I thought there are other restaurants with better tasting dim sum."
5,kendycandy,Budapest,Hungary,19-July-2019,"The food is really amazing. Nobody actually spoke English but they showed us Menu with photos for ordering since everything is written in Chinese. The place is huge and has this Traditional
Chinese Vibe. The place is pricey but absolutely worth it. I definitely recommend for everyone whos looking for perfect Chinese dining experience."
6,ksjlow,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,21-May-2019,"We went there for brunch and there was quite a queue. While waiting for our table, we walked around the garden in the restaurant. We were seated in the first hall on the ground floor.

The restaurant serves delicious Dim Sum. The service of the staff can be said to be not consistent. While we had a good experience at the restaurant, we did see a table next to us not being served adequately as they were seated in the corner of the hall. We also had no problem communicating with the staff as we spoke either Mandarin or Cantonese with the staff.

Would definitely visit the restaurant again when we are in Guangzhou."
7,TroelsJ61,Den Bosch,The Netherlands,23-February-2019,"As an expat this place is unique. Approx 60 years old it has seen its best days and live on old glory. Lots of private dining rooms.

Staff was not very attentive and sloppy with serving. The food was average at best.

Got it was only my hosts that kept me from walking out."
8,emma_china0626,None,None,4-May-2018,"The food was ok but the chicken we ordered looked miserable and tastes raw. The fish soup was good with large portions. The place is beautiful and huge however very empty during the trade show season for some reason. Not recommending"
9,dtarheel,England,United Kingdom,24-April-2018,"It’s a Chinese garden in the middle of a bustling metropolis. The juxtaposition of old and new and grey and green is fantastic!

The food is decent - nothing to shout about and pricing was reasonable I suppose as well for what is a higher need Cantonese restaurant in Guangzhou.

We had a number of dishes - roasted goose (which was nice and fat; although some of the bonier parts of the meat weren’t very tender); roasted char xiu (fat and awesome, but the slices were smallish); clay pot pig’s intestines with duck cooked in some kind of Chinese wine (meh); noodles with black mushrooms (simple, elegant dish); Kai Lan with tenderloin (the greens were fantastic, the tenderloin was not tender and it boggles my mind why anyone would offer tenderloin when it is about the most tasteless part of a cow/bull you can eat?); braised pork belly with picked veggies in a clay pot (in my mind the best item of all - but I am biased towards anything with fat in it); some fried chive dumplings; a lotus root soup and finally some buns (no idea why that was ordered at all).

Service was spotty - I spoke in mandarin and Cantonese and they understood me but appeared either confused by the instruction or perhaps the complexity of the instruction (in which case it was totally on me for asking for cut chili) or they had a hard time finding cut chili. Then again i had also asked for chili in chili oil several times and when they finally brought it to the table, put it in front of someone else. I’m calling it - they were confused because they probably weren’t paying much attention. They also messed up our beverage order - how difficult is it to understand 3 Tsingtao?

Having said that, I enjoyed the food I spite of the lack of a premium quality. The ambience as great."
10,oceancalmer,Medan,Indonesia,4-April-2018,"The place is very nice traditional resto styled.

This place is good for dimsum. For ala carte chinese lunch, this place is absolutely overrated. I think the plus point is the environment.

Ordered XiauLongBao, ginger sauce was not given. The taste.... (2 pieces eaten but not finished, the other 2 left untouched). So more or less I state my point of view. ;)

HaKau is so-so. Egg tart is so-so. Service is so-so.

In conclusion, visit this place if you want to see nice traditional resto. But do not expect to much from the food.

1st pict is the 2 pieces XiauLongBao left untouched."
11,Hamish C,Folkestone,United Kingdom,29-December-2017,"This was the second time I've eaten here in 2 years both times really excellent food. The best thing however is the atmosphere, decorated in the original style when it was first opened in about 1820, with a scenic courtyard and interesting interior decor. Both times hard to geta booking as its very popular."
12,Andy F,None,None,13-July-2017,"One of the most beautiful Chinese style restaurant in Guangzhou. Gorgeous place， spectacular building，excellent Guangzhou food. Prices not cheap through."
13,wks2017,Singapore,None,11-June-2017,"Dropped by BeiYuan last week while in Guangzhou. A well presented dining experience and the food is great. Prices are very reasonable but do come earlier to wait for a table. A good place to host guests in Guangzhou （why? no need to drink spirits at the breakfast table)"
14,hamishclifton,Folkestone,United Kingdom,18-December-2016,"This restaurant was established 90 years ago. Its set inside a large well kept old house with small pod with carp, hanging lanterns, and a wealth of decor to satisfy ones thirst for authentic Chinese atmosphere, like the carefully carved wooden grapes almost art deco on side of the upper dining room.

The food is quite simply, wonderful in Cantonese style, we had roast goode, a vegetarian tofu and celery and sweetcorn dish, some delicious  Dan Tart  (Portuguese style egg tarts) etc. About the best overall Chinese meal I have eaten."
15,Chun pang L,None,None,26-August-2016,"Comparing with Nan Yuan, the size of garden as well as restaurant is smaller, but the detail thing of Guangzhou dim sum, ambience, hygiene...are much better. The range of choice in the afternoon is not big, it provides less range with more focused quality food and dim sum. The speed of service is better too. Looking around, most customers are local Guangzhou fellows, with less tourists or foreigners, might be it stay away from metro, or have less exposure on public advertising. But in terms of light afternoon dim sum feast, quality is fantastic. If you were dim sum and tea fans, or a selfies guy, you should go to there once."
16,Allkuans,Singapore,Singapore,28-June-2016,"Bei Yuan has a long history since 1928 and the food doesn't disappoint especially to us from Singapore. The waiting time was not too long and we took our time to take in the beautiful setting of the building. It is one of China's top restaurants and we fully agree after a sumptuous lunch. We ordered many dishes including some of the staff's recommendations.
All were top-notch. We were advised to order the 'Cheong Fun' which we were of course very familiar with. We were surprised by the appearance of a plate of plain white rice roll. Just with side dishes of peanut sauce and soybean paste sauce. We all were won over by the smoothness of the 'Chee Cheong Fun' - the best rice roll we have ever tasted."
17,synthiab,None,None,10-February-2016,"Went here for my husbands birthday. The staff is excellent, very attentive and friendly. Food is outstanding, everything we tried was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and has an authentic feel to it. I would highly recommend it."
18,ryanteo,None,None,19-June-2015,"This restaurant is located right opposite Yuexiu Park. It is a long-established restaurant well-known for its authentic Canton cuisine. The restaurant is very reputable among local residents. Wide selections of Canton dishes, food quality and staff service are excellent."
19,Philip P,None,None,30-October-2019,"We had lunch there. Traditional Chinese restaurant with a Michelin recognition. Ground level rather large, nearly cantine, but upstairs private rooms with excellent service and great food. Really spectacular!"
20,WSY11,Singapore,Singapore,4-September-2019,"We came here after our ferry cruise. Having tried another branch, we are pleased to note the food quality control is good. The good standards are maintained at this restaurant too.

As this is a bigger restaurant, the waiting time is shorter . Service is good too."
21,pancakesforlunch,None,None,8-May-2019,"The service was rather fast, restaurant easy to spot as it’s a big building on its own. The portions are just nice for 4-5 pax. Must try : silken tofu, charsiew & siobah!"
22,vinceta2015,Singapore,Singapore,1-June-2018,"Went to HuaYin outlet because it is the msin restaurant at 10pm. The restaurant is still crowded at this hour but the popular dishes like roasted meat and chicken have been sold out. I ordered other dishes instead. I can see it is a popular restaurant as the taxi drivers knew the location well. Serving was not very fast but bearable in waiting time.
The restaurant wifi is powerful and I managed to communicate via Whatsapp there. Recommended."
23,hamishclifton,Folkestone,United Kingdom,6-January-2018,"We visited with 2 Chinese friends. There aren't many westerners but its incredibly popular with discerning Chinese and the restaurant fils 5 floors. The food is excellent and being Cantonese cuisine is relatively easy for westerners.

The whole place is a buzz and you have to book. You may need a Chinese speaking friend or concierge to handle that part for you! The place is spilling over with customers and that's half the fun of eating out. Its an interesting experience and worth booking."
24,thomasgO6630KR,None,None,8-June-2017,"Traditional Chinese food Nice place to enjoy Chinese Big restaurant, fast service , many special dishes"
25,wks2017,Singapore,None,29-May-2017,"In Guangzhou for some meetings and the family tagged along. For us, Bingsheng at Haiyin Bridge is a must every time we are in Guangzhou.

Being a true Cantonese restaurant, the dishes run out with time (they prepare a finite number to ensure freshness) so come early like 1700 to pick up a table.

Classics like Char Siew (叉烧）,Tofu (水鬼重）are great. We usually sample the seasonal dishes that changes for variety. Top it up with a French Buns (法式餐包) which are actually extremely fluffy Char Siew Buns. However, the restaurant runs at the frantic pace so everything gets served together. A neat trick is, if the tables in the main areas are taken, just pay a little more for a private dining. It's worth it.

Fantastic value for money too.

Enjoy!"
26,Chun pang L,None,None,27-August-2016,"We ordered a local dish if steamed chicken, and fried vegetable and soup. Though it was already after 8:00pm, people still full there. But service was slow and inefficient. The dish of steamed chicken supposed to be a signature choice, but quite disappointing that, it was too hard and taste was not deeply through. I did visit 3 other branches of the same cuisine, but this head branch was the worst I had ever experienced."
27,Bax_in_BKK,None,None,30-April-2015,"Some of the very best Chinese food I have ever eaten. The goose was good, but the stand out was the salmon. Highly recommended for authentic Cantonese cuisine"
28,bcheong,Bangkok,Thailand,11-January-2015,"Came here for lunch and supposedly a popular place. It's a large 7 storey restaurant and was indeed quite packed. Got a private room and ordered the usual Cantonese fare - steamed fish, goose intestines , pineapple buns etc. They were mostly ok. What stuck out for us was how surly and disinterested the staff were. They all seemed to be either robotic or hate their jobs"
29,Chet D,Zhongshan District,Taipei,16-June-2014,"Although I was travelling by myself, i just had to sample enough food for four people and it was all very excellent. My favorite dish was a chilled white fish dish (sorry don't recall the name). Also, the scallops are excellent. I wish I would of tried the plates of sashimi white fish(don't know the name), it was one of the house specialties and everyone was eating plenty of it. The tofu dish was very nice and they had many versions from which to choose. I would recommend this place to everyone and the larger the group the better. Very good service for a restaurant with limited English speaking staff."
30,Andrew_Alin,Greater Adelaide,Australia,7-March-2014,"The dinner we had here was one of the best meals we had in guangzhou. We ordered 2 different types of shellfish, mantis prawns, a beef dish, and a vegetarian mushroom dish. All were fantastic, and you can taste the freshness of the seafood.

Prices were reasonable for a restaurant of this quality, and the staff were friendly and efficient.

We'll definitely be back here again next visit to guangzhou."
31,Esh9,Tualatin,Oregon,22-February-2014,"We had a lot of good food in Guangzhou, but this place was the best. The wait staff was attentive and welcoming and the food was incredible. Apparently westerners are not too common there, as our young waiter was excited to practice his English, and asked us to pose in a  selfie  with him. Every dish was excellent, but the pineapple buns are especially good. The seafood is fresh, harvested from the many tanks in the back end of the restaurant. Great food at very reasonable prices."
32,Jinky L,manila,None,21-January-2014,"All floors of this restaurant building were packed with locals. Every dish we had was yummy- the cold cuts, vegetables (mushrooms, abalone, greens,) fish, beef, pork, hotpot, desserts. Tip: don't bother ordering the lowly carbs such as rice & noodles. Make space for the main dishes!"
33,HappyfeetII,None,None,7-December-2019,"Chinese food done very well. Insofar the most memorable dinner place I’ve had in Guangzhou, surpassing even Hong Kong and Singapore experiences. I will return for sure.

(And I insisted for the polo bun (served in 6) for dinner - no regrets, truly the best ever - size of Thai fragrant coconut but don’t worry - it’s hollow inside!)"
34,ConanC_12,Los Angeles,California,3-November-2019,"The tables for two dinners are so close (closer than McD, KFC) that I literally listened to a women talked the whole time. The food was ok but all left available on the menu around 2:30pm were most profitable items I can say. There was not much service and luckily we weren’t charged with 15%service fee. The waiter placing our order were all about pushing for sale, sale, sale but LISTENING. If you are looking for some special dishes that are only available here, go for it, or try somewhere else."
35,vt523,Brisbane,Australia,12-October-2019,"This restaurant was recommended to us by a local and we were not disappointed. The dishes that were a standout to us were the roast pork, BBQ pork, pork and taro, steamed egg. We came for dinner two nights in a row before left Guangzhou. Pays to be early or attend later as there were a lot of people waiting inside and outside of the restaurant waiting for a table when we left the restaurant. Worth a visit if you are in Guangzhou."
36,Mary L,None,None,9-October-2019,"This is a pretty famous restaurant in Guangzhou. We were here because the taxi driver recommended to my friend. They have lots of variety of dishes on the menu but the price seems to be expensive. We ordered one small crab with roe on a very big plate cost about 450 yuan. And frankly i don't see any crab roe in it, but you can taste the crab roe in powdery sauce and the body of the crab is so small but the crab shell is very big. We ended up paying 800 over yuan for 3 dishes. The service is considered good but you can find a better restaurant with better food serve in Guangzhou."
37,WSY11,Singapore,Singapore,4-September-2019,"We were so impressed by the food and the service that we went back there 3 times during our stay.

We ordered their signature black char siew, polo Bao, goose intestines and the double milk dessert, amongst other food.

The char siew simply melts in your mouth & the polo Bao is the best we had eaten so far."
38,PushExplore,None,None,18-June-2019,"The Bingsheng PinWei Restaurant was awesome. Such a large variety of exotic dishes. A little expensive, but the food was worth it. Quite enjoyed dining here."
39,dorsalmo,Florissant,Missouri,22-April-2019,"I'm not sure how accessible this place is. Some Chinese colleagues took me here one night during my visit. The place feels fancy, but there were families there and the guests seemed to act fairly casual. The service is good, and the food is decent. It's probably one of the better lunches/dinners I had while in China (but that's not saying much because most of the others were bad).

The most different thing about this place is that the menu is HUGE. No, wait... that's not enough emphasis... IT WAS HUUUUUUGE!!!!! The thing is literally a book. Kudos to them for everything being displayed in a large picture. Obviously they pride themselves on the large variety of exotic food they serve. I'm a fairly adventurous eater, and I tried a lot of exotic food while I was in China, but I have to say there was a lot on that menu that I wouldn't want to eat. Still, there's so much to choose from that you're bound to find something good."
40,313globetrotter,Singapore,Singapore,30-March-2019,"This is one of the most popular restaurants in GuangZhu. There are several outlets spreading in different areas in GuangZhu. The TianHE Branch is my favourite. The restaurant has individual rooms for dinners, who require privacy. Some rooms have own toilets!!! The restaurants also has open area, where by dinners can share with other dinners. The Service is Very Good AND THE STAFF VERY POLITE and helpful. The car park is huge and good. The quality of food is Very Good and the price acceptable. The ambience is Good. there ARE SOME SPECIAL DISHES THAT only AVAILABLE FROM THIS RESTAURANT !!! Try it for the experience !!!"
41,dickwan,World,None,10-March-2019,"Visited restaurant just 45mins before closing time. Rushed to order the food and did not have high expectations. However, was pleasantly surprised that the standard of food served was not compromised. Highly recommend the crispy skin roasted pork belly and halibut in a claypot. Try to allow for more time as they have many dishes to savour."
42,Applebananananana,Singapore,Singapore,10-November-2018,"After reading the multiple good reviews, I was really looking forward to some authentic, delicious Cantonese fare at Bingsheng Pinwei. As such, I had ordered the restaurant's specialities - the Black Char Siew and Braised Tofu. However, I was nothing but disappointed with not one but both dishes. The char siew was too fatty and tough to chew - it could not even be cut properly wth chopsticks. The braised tofu was bland and had a weird taste to it - seems like the combination of fish head/bones and jelly pork just did not go well together. We were also supposed to have ordered another vegetable dish (which I am glad we did not given the poor quality of the other dishes) but the waiter had gotten our order wrong so we cancelled it in the end. Service was average and location is definitely not the most convenient - you have to get out from the right exit of Taikoo Mall, otherwise please be prepared for a long walk to the venue. In all, this was not a pleasant experience for us and we have definitely tasted much better Cantonese food elsewhere."
43,jay a,None,None,6-November-2018,"Restaurant was recommended by a friend, I was expecting a lot we have been to a very good restaurant the night before. I was not disappointed the cantonese cooking was superb everything we ordered is delicious. The crispy pork was amazing."
44,rtansfdc,Georgia,None,6-November-2018,"I expected to see more Cantonese food in Guangzhou but in maybe it has changed. Most people in Guangzhou don't even speak Cantonese. Sad!!! There are so many Chinese migrated from the north and because of that, Guangzhou restaurants changed as well. This restaurant offer so much Cantonese dishes I wished we have time to come back to try all of them. Price is not super cheap but not too expensive neither."
45,alastair4,Christchurch,New Zealand,3-November-2018,"I was with my work colleague from China, who was excited about us visiting this restaurant ( one of a number ) that he claims as being famous for serving local Cantonese cuisine. Certainly an impressive restaurant in respect to size. I believe this particular restaurant covers four floors with large dining rooms that were full of diners. The atmosphere is busy due to the number of diners and the size of the restaurant room. The service was prompt and friendly, though unfortunately I was disappointed with the food, though of course this might be that the style does not suit my palate. We ordered the goose ( no duck was available ) and I found it to be too fatty, this was followed by a mixed plate of pork that again was fatty and I could not finish or enjoy. Deep fried eggplant again just did not tick the box for me. Not a pleasant meal for me but obviously by the reviews this is a local favourite.."
46,ksarman,Yangon (Rangoon),Myanmar,28-September-2018,"I can say that it s a huge restaurant
But look like it s an culinary institution
I am not an expert on Chinese food but it was so good and tasty
The dinning is full of life , I mean, noisy like hell
Nice experience"
47,chingmanj,None,None,12-May-2018,"A local friend brought us here. I’m from Hong Kong and I’m used to Cantonese restaurant. However, I’m surprised and excited to see lots of dishes I’ve never seen before, original from the restaurant itself. The restaurant is spacious and the menu looks very impressive. We ordered quite a lot of food and they are all very delicious."
48,caothinh,None,None,28-April-2018,"Not worth waiting for 1 hour to get a table, booking via telephone is not available since there are too many customers come. The only way to get a table is to come and pick a table and queue."
49,21parisf,None,None,20-March-2018,"This restaurant is the real deal! You must try the stuffed peppers. Also, the various noodle dishes are amazing. Some of the meal had some spice to it- but wow!!! Just wow!!"
50,cy_sg,Singapore,Singapore,29-December-2017,"My wife and I dined at Bing Sheng on our recent visit to Guangzhou. This particular outlet is located just across the road from the upscale Taikoo Hui mall, which means it is quite easily accessible via metro. It's closer to the Mandarin Oriental end of Taikoo Hui and you only need to cross a busy road junction to get across to Bing Sheng.

We were there on a Sunday afternoon and it was crowded at lunch hour. Fortunately, we were able to find the last table in the restaurant which was just next to the main door. This is a busy restaurant with a wide variety of patrons including families and couples, although they appeared to be largely local - this can't be a bad thing. As with many of Guangzhou's larger restaurant chains, the menu was in both English and Chinese and there were photos to accompany the dishes - well presented but this also meant flipping through a rather heavy, book-like menu.

Between the 2 of us, we ordered a Honey BBQ Pork dish (Char Siew), a beancurd dish (cooked in 3 different styles), a Claypot Beef and a Vinegared Cabbage dish. As with our other experiences at restaurants in Guangzhou, there was a long interval in between the serving of dishes. Our BBQ Pork dish arrived within 10 minutes of ordering, but the gap between the subsequent dishes ranged between 10 to 20 minutes, which resulted in some of the earlier dishes turning cold by the time the other dishes arrived. It didn't help that we were seated near the main door and they left the main doors wide open (on a particularly cold December day).

This food quality was good, and the service was acceptable. The BBQ Pork and the Claypot Angus Beef were particularly memorable. That said, it would have been great if the dishes could have been served at closer intervals but I guess they have different chefs who specialise in different dishes; and the crowds weren't helping as well. This was our most expensive meal in Guangzhou (at about 40-45USD for 2 including tea and steamed rice). Not a bad meal but not cheap by Guangzhou standards."
51,Lady_Snowhawk,Greater London,United Kingdom,14-December-2017,"Very lovely restaurant, was very busy but service was still super fast and efficient. Located right next to the Taihoo mall so it was really easy for us to travel here. This place serves some pretty unique food, such as their famous tofu three ways and super crispy pork belly. The latter only had a very small serving however, and it was way too fatty for our taste (coming from someone who enjoys more than just lean meat). The actual taste was overrided by the overwhelming taste of fat which practically was leaking out of the meat when you bit into it. The tofu was very smooth and delicious however, and was served with some mince and sweetcorn just to add some other flavours in.

Along with these, we also had a very refreshing soup, duck and turbot, all for a very reasonable price. I generally only like dim sum restaurants, but this place actually had a huge variety of dishes that I would definitely recommend (such as the tofu or the soup)."
52,alvinsasmita,Jakarta,Indonesia,26-July-2017,"Went to BingSheng for dinner. Have to say we probably had the best pork belly ever. It literally melts in your mouth. Other menus were also cooked right and quality of the ingredients were good, though the cuts were not always feom the best part. Couldn't complaint with the pricing they have though.
Each serving portion was just about right for 3-4 people.
Overall we had a great dinner with a reasonable price. It's not the cheapest but definitely not expensive and worth every penny."
53,gamrerk,None,None,7-July-2017,"Good food with reasonable price. My most favorites are roasted pork (char-siew) and pineapple bun. Note that portion of the buns is super big, I have to take 4 of them home."
54,demandingp,Taipei,Taiwan,22-May-2017,"I usually stay at Mandarin Oriental and the restaurant is just across the street. Food was extremely nice and the price is affordable.

Don;t be afraid to go in as it look like a mid-range restaurant but indeed the price is cheap for RMB 40-80 a dish.

One of my favorite Chinese Restaurant in GZ."
55,KanMacau,Macau,None,19-April-2017,"Had lunch there during our last visit to Guangzhou. We went there at noon without reservation but we were still assigned a table. The décor is maintained in its own style across the chain and the menu is also similar. Service is fine and food is served quite efficiently. I would come back again to this restaurant in next visit to Guangzhou."
56,philipperO754EH,None,None,10-April-2017,"It is rare to find in Guangzhou an elegant restaurant. This is one, with a view on the iconic Guangzhou Tower. Food is good too... A floor is the common ding room and another floor(s) offers private rooms in even more luxury."
57,Eline S,None,None,10-April-2017,"Excellent food, prompt service. There best I've eaten in Guangzhou since being here! The fried aubergines/crab tanghoon really stood out. The food here is interesting and pretty innovative as well!"
58,705huil,Austin,Texas,16-February-2017,"The place is for locals- evidenced by the stools lined up at front door, and the crowds gathered for a weekday dinner. Went there with BFF and spent $30 for much more than what we can consume. We like the Duran cake, the tofu dish (水鬼重 with duck) and a veggie dish (小炒皇）Service is adequate. Remember to call ahead reserve a spot in the queue waiting."
59,FoodieHKSG,None,None,30-December-2016,"Lots of customers even after so many years, they are the best food I have eaten in Guang Zhou, continuous innovation is their secret of success"
60,Alex5590,Selangor,Malaysia,5-December-2016,"Bingsheng restaurant have a few branches in Guangzhou, so we choose the Jiangtai Road branch because
very to Jiangtai Metro station. Arrived at about 1.30pm for lunch & was not crowded. Most of the people in the restaurant
are local here.

Menu were easy to order all the dishes are photo in the menu. We order steam chicken, black char siew, goose intestines, roast goose, steam fish & Choy sum. We want to order siew yoke but was sold out. Excellent taste yummy to us no complaints, reasonable price will definitely come back to try Siew yoke, crispy BBQ pork & others."
61,DrTim2016,Los Angeles,California,29-November-2016,"There are two parts to this restaurant. As you get to the entrance the left side is the more fancy side while the right side is where the locals go. If you go to the right side (like I did) you better go with a local. No one spoke English so you are left to look at the pictures and using google translate [which I cannot post what it said!], which is fine, but as is almost always the case the pictures are much better than reality!

The servers were nice but laughing the whole time because communication was hard. Order the barbecue pork, fried rice and fried eggplant (I think). The eggplant was fine, the fried rice ok and the pork nothing but fat. Overall a mediocre meal but the place was crowded and I was warned that lines can be long to get in so I will take some blame in not being able to communicate well enough.

Plus the while the entire meal was only $32."
62,SuinaKnows,Irvine,California,9-May-2016,"I love coming here... Dream of coming back here, every time I am in town. The line is very long, everyday. Try to call ahead to line up with your phone number. My colleagues/locals who work also come here all the time! Famous for their crispy and black pork, you cannot find them anywhere else. I personally like the crispy one.., crunchy then melt in your mouth . Their tofu dish is also very good, as they make in house (I usually order the plain style with 3 colors). There is this veggie (similar to very thin celery) that I also order every time. It is unique to the south region. Every table also order the gigantic pineapple bun that is soft and sweet. The service is quick, efficient, and friendly. Love it here."
63,SaadSeeb,None,None,29-April-2016,"Was taken here by local friends. Huge restaurant with multiple floors and very busy. Had sashimi and crab and a host of other seafood dishes. All were good."
64,Patsy_L5,Singapore,None,22-April-2016,"This is one restaurant that I have been coming back to dine every time I travel to GZ. The standard of the food is very consistent; it has remained the same for the past 4 yrs since I first started patronising it. Visited another branch but this branch is better. Usually we go for the roast goose; succulent meat with its special sauce dribbled over it. The tofu is also good. Another item that is a must have is the soup. We usually order the daily special, nothing fanciful but wholesome home cooked taste to it. There's also this vegetable dish with lotus root slices and other greens fried together. Very yummy too. Overall, this is a restaurant that offers good food at reasonable prices. Best of all, it is open till late and we can come here at 10 plus for dinner after all the retail shops have closed. The only thing is, the roast goose would have sold out by then! Otherwise, be prepared to queue for at least 30-45 mins during dinner peak hours. They offer you stools to sit outside restaurant and free wifi. Service wise, we have no problems with the efficient staff and never felt pressurized to order extra food. For 4 adults, we usually order the soup plus another 3 dishes."

67,Cunovanthoff,Amsterdam,The Netherlands,20-November-2015,"This restaurant is immens popular with the local Guangzhou people. Big and crowded, with a lot of private dining rooms. The food is quite rural, nothing very special but nothing to complain about. Waiters don't speak any English and are sometimes a bit unexperienced (especially with foreigners). Worth visiting, just to get the Canton experience."
68,Henna P,None,None,4-November-2015,"visited this restaurant for lunch, and had the opportunity to taste various Cantonese delicacies, incl very good dim sum, and the restaurant´s special pineapple buns for dessert. excellent food, and a nice view to the Canton Tower."

73,Pradeep R,None,None,7-August-2015,"Excellent Cantonese food. The durian pastry is very good and delicate. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Pineapple buns also very good. I like most of the food here. They run out of items if you are late. The fish congee, rice noodles with fish belly and fried Tofu fish (Bombay Duck) were all excellent"
74,nicolausm532,Geneva,Switzerland,29-July-2015,"Had lunch and loved the food. Service was very quick too and pretty attentive, pictures make chosing easier for those who cannot converse with the locals.
With so many dishes to chose from, it was a pity we were only two, best is to go in a group of at least 6 so everyone can taste a little of everything."
75,Robert C,Mt Eliza,Australia,15-June-2015,"We were told by two locals that Binsheng was  the best and most famous restaurant in Guangzhou , so we were eagerly looking forward to dining there. After a ten minute queue for a table, which we were told to expect, we were seated and looked through the very extensive menu with photos of every item. After making our five selections we learnt that three of them were not available so we settled on some alternatives. All this was done with a combination of pointing and other forms of sign language as no one on the staff spoke a word of English. We could not fault their friendliness and willingness to help but it was not easy for them or for us. When the food arrived at our table it was not the highlight we had expected. Nice, but we have had the equal, and better, in Camtonese restaurants in Australia however it was astonishingly cheap and that went some way to easing the disappointment."
76,TeikBoon C,None,None,10-June-2015,"We went on recommendation by our hotel. It was Mother's day on 10 May 2015 and when we got there, there was a long line. Surprisingly, the line moved quickly and we later found out that the restaurant is huge with 5 or 6 storeys of dining halls and rooms. We were led to a private room which normally accommodates 10 but there were only 2 of us.
We were limited in our dinner selection and decided on the captain's recommendation of the char siew, fish head and tofu soup, and fried dumplings. There was also a special char siew which we ordered and OMG how sinfully good it was! The way I can describe it is that it is char siew that is some 80% fat, sugar coated and then deepfried. Unique, delicious but just too rich to finish. The roast goose was very good, tender meat with crispy skin. The dumplings had a unique texture to it, crispy to the bite at the top but soft on the underside, very good.
This being a private room and the fact that it was Mother's Day, the wait staff appeared occasionally and hurriedly, to see if we needed anything. This will be a restaurant I want to return with a larger group to try the extensive menu they have."
77,ryanteo,None,None,14-May-2015,"This restaurant chain serves excellent Cantonese cuisine at reasonable prices. Food quality maintains by them has never disappointed us. Staff service is excellent too. Prior reservation is recommended."

81,tianshi,singapore,None,30-January-2015,"Bingsheng was introduced to me 5 years ago on my first trip to Guangzhou. It has been my favourite since and everytime i return to guangzhou, it is on my must go to list. The food here is typical Cantonese cuisine and the highlight is their roasted pork (cha siew). It is well barbequed with their own special sauce and the meat is tender on the inside but crispy on the outside.
Service is good too. If you have a party of four, you may ask for a private room where you will be spared the noise of the communal hall diners. Great for business meetings."
82,Long M,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,25-December-2014,"Trying to give you an old style look for its decor and outlook. But everything inside is pretty new.

Food is Cantonese style and quite good.

Just that you have to get there early.

If you are late, you may have to wait for some time before you can get a table."
83,Chun pang L,None,None,15-November-2014,"The cuisine was designed with Southern Chinese style, with wooden window frames, wooden sliding doors, grey brick wall...service was average, food was not bad too. But their freshly baked pineapple bun was marvellous and you are not affordable to miss"
84,FiddlingTravelNotes,None,None,9-September-2014,"Across the street from Mandarin Oriental and Fraser Suites. Great selection of Cantonese dishes with a good choice of fresh seafood. A true winner!"
85,taolxd,Sant Pol de Mar,Spain,14-June-2014,"We had to wait outside for 30 minutes to get a table, but since it was so famous we thought it worth the wait. We had char siu (roasted pork), tofu, chillies with meat, and pineapple buns. The char siu, much raved about, is good but a little on the fatty side. The tofu was nice, subtle, soft and delicate. The chillies with meat topping were my favourite- a little spicy and rich in taste. The  pineapple buns  are another famous dish from this restaurant and tasty; note that the smallest order is 6 pieces so be prepared to bring some home if you are not a larger group.

Overall a good dinner, if you are in the area. Better to invite some friends so you can sample more dishes. Service was adequate and prices are reasonable."
86,Webin M,Manila,Philippines,19-April-2014,"I checked my Tripadvisor and found this restaurant, no reservation by phone is accepted. We took a taxi to get there and found nearly a hundred people waiting for table. We had to queue for a table, which took a good 1 hour.

Is it good? No. We ordered a total of 2 appetizers and 4 main dish plus 1 appetizer. To be honest, only the Char Siu is good...it's delicious. There are 2 Char Siu, the regular one and the chef special, the Black Char Siu (which is not as good as the regular Char Siu), we tried both. The regular Char Siu is melt in the mouth, lightly and perfectly glazed, just the right flavor...it's perfect! We ordered the White chicken, Fish, beef and sausage with vegetable...nothing good. The appetizers are not so good, and the coconut pudding , not so good.

If you want to go to this restaurant, just order the Char Siu..2 orders please!"
87,Andrew_Alin,Greater Adelaide,Australia,7-March-2014,"The food is good here, and prices are reasonable. However, it is pretty much essential to have a chinese speaker in your group, as many of the  specialty  dishes may not appeal to western palates.

We had the pineapple buns for entree, a roast goose dish, charsiu pork, sharkfin soup, and a mixed mushrooms plate. All were yummy, with the goose being the stand out dish of the night."
88,MeiL67,Singapore,Singapore,1-February-2014,"Critics call Bing Sheng overrated while locals turn their noses up at the Cantonese chain for its commercialized image, but like it or not, the restaurant dishes up some of the better Cantonese food I've had in China in long while.

We enjoyed the char siu (glazed roast pork) tremendously, which was tender with just the right amount of marinade - just the way good char siu should be served. I find the char siu at many restaurants, including some of the celebrated ones in HK, dry and sinewy.

Other recommended dishes include the bo lo bao (pineapple bun), which was light and fluffy, making it the perfect dessert or appetizer, depending on one's preferences; the scallion noodles; and any of the homemade silken tofu creations. Note that the bo lo bao comes in a dozen or a half dozen only.

The entire menu is in Chinese and servers don't really speak English. Also, either come really early or be prepared to wait for a table. We called ahead to find out how much of a wait there was and planned for a late dinner to avoid the crowds. Walking in at 9pm on a Saturday, we were ushered to our table immediately."
89,Tom Y,Las Vegas,Nevada,26-November-2013,"Visited this restaurant 11/26/13
This is one of the most famous restaurant in Guangzhou. If you don't speak Chinese, you may want to wait till you go with a Chinese friend. Most of the staff don't speak English. The menu shows a lot of pictures that you can pick. If you manage to get the manager to recommend a few famous dishes, you may not like them. I suggest look at the pictures in the menu and pick the ones that appeal to you.

We ordered the dual Cha siu or BBQ Pork. It is oily and fatty but they were very good. We ordered the goose intestine in soyer sauce, the special bean curd and the famous pineapple Bun. We loved everything we ordered.

The place was nicely decorated.
It was clean, including the bathroom
Service was under average. we had to ask to have hot tea refilled about 8 times. They never came and checked.
Price was reasonable. The three of us ordered 5 dishes and it was about $300RMB. They don't accept Visa, Master Card or AMEX. They took my Discover Card which does not have the Union Pay Logo. I carry a note from Discover explaining to business owners how to process the charge. The Discover Card is widely used in China."
90,DaveandLing,None,None,13-November-2013,"Nice meal which showcased all that Cantonese cuisine has to offer, however the setting was way over the top with dining areas set up as private booths. Was like eating in your hotel bedroom with guests."

Forget about it unless you are really lucky...
My experience there is amazing because it was my second experience in a restaurant in Guangzhou after 99cents...
Every time you will ask for your favourite or classic dish, the answer will be no more then after four time there, i say no more too...
Not worht it it is a headache, every time we go there.
Positive Goose tarot is a must you have to try it and the braised mushroom mix is really tasty.
Good luck in the queue and bring your chinese friend if you don't speak the local dialect..."
93,bisu77,Turin,Italy,19-June-2013,"the only problem they don't speak one world of english.
All the rest is amazing. We had a private room for a party of 16 people, which is pretty common in china. But this room was so nice! very elegant and very well taken care of. Furniture very nice. Huge room with private bathroom, really clean.
We had the most amazing food, luckily they have pictures on the menu and the menu is in english.
Bill: around 110 rmb per person"
94,dlcmilan,None,None,17-May-2013,"The bbq roast pork is a must, the puffed up pineapple buns also. Go there early, if not the specialties will be sold out. Reasonably priced. Service is not special. We've been to several Bingsheng restaurants, never disappointed and the overall clean."
95,xcschlr,Kansas City,Kansas,28-December-2012,"A friend of mine took me to this restaurant, and I was glad I had the chance to dine there. The dishes were very flavorful without being overly greasy or salty. Because I did not order the dishes, I cannot tell you the names of the dishes that I had there. It is better to go there with a large group of people, so that you can taste more of its fine dishes."
96,GwennSingapore,Singapore,Singapore,24-December-2012,"This franchise restaurant was recommended by a friend. Pretty good, but the roasted salted chicken was too salty and tough for my liking. Nevertheless, the other dishes were good. Tofu is a must try. Very silky and smooth. We paid approximately US$35 for three mains and one dessert."
97,Steven P,None,None,9-November-2012,"Great atmosphere matched by incredibly tasty food, served by very friendly and helpful staff. While pricey by local standards, they are quite reasonable compared with a similar type restaurant in say, Hong Kong."
98,Rajiv_Gopinath,None,None,28-October-2012,"Order the dual Cha siu - the darker version served with the lighter version. The darker version has the white pork meat, a layer of fat and the caramelised crust. The light brown version is predominantly fat. It comes at rmb 68 and serves 2-3. Arrive and order by 6:30 pm as it sells out fast. All the best for your Cha Siu order."
99,qasr,canada,None,12-July-2012,"High priced food that tastes okay. A little too much on the greasy side for me, even for Chinese food. Went there 5 hours before closing and was disappointed that they had already sold out of a few items on their menu. Singapore-style rice noodles were okay. Food was palatable, just not spectacular enough to match the setting."

101,iPathfinder91,Davao City,Philippines,29-April-2012,"I read about the recommendation of someone about this Cantonese Restaurant in a magazine and planned to check it out for dinner. When we arrived there, the place looks fabulous and we luckily got a table. We did not order that much due to the unexpected prices. They served us Chinese Tea. The dishes that were served are quite nice to see, but the taste was just like any typical Cantonese Restaurant for me. When the bill came out, we were shocked that the tea came out of the bill even if we didn't even touch it. The waiter did not allow us to cancel the tea on our bill. My final say to this restaurant is just that it's just neutral."
102,david g,new york,None,28-March-2012,"Bingsheng is one of the top names in chinese cuisine in guangzhou, so we had pretty high expectations when we went. Food was by no means bad but it wasn't that good either. Could probably find plenty of ordinary restaurants with the same quality of food at much cheaper price and much better service. Reservations are not accepted (except for private rooms) and there was a big queue from before 6pm. The service was terrible even for china's standards. It was by far the worst service we've encountered for all of china.
For example, we were very thirsty after a whole day of walking and asked for cokes when we sat down at the table. They insisted that we order tea first and just wouldn't let us order coke just coz they wanted to charge for tea per person. Even when we promise to order tea later, they wouldn't budge. We had to say we would pay for tea no matter what until they reluctantly brought us cans of coke. As for food, their famous tofu was decent but we found most other places with the same kind of quality. Soup and fish head in claypot was also quite ok. but then again this kind of quality doesn't justify the wait, the price, and the suffering of the terrible service. The only things we found good were the goose intestine fried with soy sauce and the puffed up pineapple buns. a"
103,Tonelim,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,5-March-2012,"I visited this restaurant in Jan and had a bad experience and thought of give it another try and see if things have improved.....

I was wronged... very wronged! The service still terrible and dishes serving was extremely slow and painful. We ordered the usual items and never in my life I had to chase for 4 times for my food! If you are game for a stressful and painful dining experience, please visit this restaurant in GZ (Zhujiang or Tianhe Dong branch). The problem is that nobody cares in this restaurant, business is good so they couldn't care less.

Never will go again!"
104,Tonelim,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,31-January-2012,"This restaurant consistently serving delicious and tasty Cantonese cuisines.

We visited based on an online article and I am so glad I came across it. When we arrived at the entrance we thought this was going to be an expensive dinner but it is not the case.
The menu is very very extensive, their signature dish is the BBQ piglet, but if you arrive late in the evening you probably will miss it.
We ordered crispy and black BBQ pork, Roasted Goose, Eel Fried Rice and stir fry of veggies/dry fish + 1 beer. Everything was absolutely delicious to the point I can't pick my favourite dish we tried. The bill came at 398 CNY, we were shocked at the bargain and will be back several times to try other dishes."
109,JohnDS123,Singapore,Singapore,10-May-2019,"I came with some Chinese friends so they did the ordering. As far as I could tell no one was speaking English so it may be difficult to order if you don't speak Chinese. We got a private room for our meal which was good. They offered good quality French red wine for a decent price. We knew that we had to order the BBQ Pork and that was as delicious as I had heard it would be. But I didn't get to try the black pork which I also heard is great. Next time. We asked what the waitress recommended for the other dishes. They said we should order Pineapple Buns. This is a speciality at this restaurant but they went largely uneaten because no one was impressed by them. I could only describe it by saying it is a Chinese style bread roll and not really what most westerners would want for dinner. The goose dish we were recommended was excellent."
110,plau678,None,None,1-December-2018,"This restaurant is across the street from the East Gate of the Guangdong Museum. It is modern and clean. Food is good but the Pineapple Bun is not that good. I read a lot of review recommending the Pineapple Bun but I could not agree with it. The bun is huge (approx 4 inches in diameter and 3 inches tall). The bun itself is soft and the inside has a Pineapple filling. One order has 6 of these buns. The Pineapple Bun is no better than a local bakery in San Francisco or Toronto China Town. I would rather save the room of my stomach for other dishes. The Fried Cucumber dish is very good with a light batter on the outside and soft inside. Other dishes are not bad but not exceptional. I like the location because it is next to the Guangdong Museum. Reservation is recommended but not necessary (depending on time and day). We went on Friday for lunch at 1 pm and there were plenty of tables."

They had changed their menu, and the soups are no longer on the main menu. Ask the waitresses what is available that day. We tried 2 soups, the silken tofu, geoduck, polo buns and scallops.

117,kenyapp,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,20-February-2018,"Not sure if it was because of the holiday season, but you better make a booking at this place or you will have no chance of getting a table. Even with 4 floors of tables.
They are famous for their charsiew and their 'polo' buns. both of which are open to individual interpretation. Their version of charsiew is glossy, soft and is cut with a large proportion of fat. Sweet tasting and sticky. Some people like it, some don't.
Their Polo Buns (colloquially so called pineapple buns) really have some pineapple fillings and not plain bread like in Hong Kong.
The rest of the dishes are typical Cantonese. Service was decent, just don't order through the busboys, cause they are busy as heck and cant entertain you."
118,youke_worldwide,Singapore,None,3-January-2018,"So classic restaurant for entertainment. We all had private rooms and very grand lobby. A lot of good dishes like fried eggplant and the big buns. But a lot of the other food were too oily for me. Their BBQ pork was delicious but circled with a lot of sugar."

Love the food here. All Cantonese way of cooking. It is neither oily Nor too salty.

The ambiance is also good for business discussions.
Service is not the TOP notch. The waitress may be a bit loud when speaking. Guess this is local culture."
120,Alywin C,Singapore,Singapore,8-October-2017,"Our family of 4 plus grandma & grandpa had dinner here during our visit to Guangzhou. Overall it was quite good. The black char siew was fatty, oily goodness. The tofu stew with mushrooms was tasty enough. The surprising dish was the fried eggplant, which was crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. We ended with a ginger milk pudding which was strong in taste but we, except the kids, enjoyed it.

Overall good place to try out Cantonese cuisine, it is popular do be prepared to wait."
121,Li Lin C,Singapore,Singapore,25-September-2017,"This is a popular place that comes highly recommended from locals. Prices are decent, if you order items such as seafood and sashimi then expect that it will cost more.

We took a long time to place our order as the menu is big and wide. Thankfully the items were also listed in english with lots of pictures to make things easier. The cuisine is cantonese, recommended dishes are their homemade tofu, charsiew and crispy char siew and chicken. Note the crispy char siew is very fatty so while delicious, a couple of pieces would be enough.

Service is good too. Our server was patient with us and recommended several dishes."

123,tinyperson729,None,None,6-July-2017,"Our family in Guangzhou were experienced enough to get an early dinner reservation so we could taste the famed char siew. They told us that it wasn't as good as normal and to be honest, it was just average, but they told us that it's normally not like this so I recommend you still try it. My dad had gotten sick from another restaurant in zhuhai, so he wasn't supposed to eat anything beside rice congee, but he couldn't help himself to try just a little of the greasy char siew, so I guess it was still really good, maybe it just wasn't to my taste. The fried eggplant was perfect. I could not stop myself from taking one after the other. The pineapple bread/bun was delicious, it just lacked filling. There was a tiny dollop of what looked to be pineapple candy in the middle of a giant bun. The bread part was heavenly. The crispy fatty pork with sauce and sugar was my favorite. (Clearly, I didn't order the food as I have no idea what it was actually called, my apologies.) It had that perfect thin crispy skin on top with that melt-in-your-mouth fat and meat beneath. It wasn't hard at all, like some restaurants make it. The skin combined with the sauce and sugar made it taste a little like Peking duck. The service sucked. They were whispering and pointing at us when we left. They acted like we were being super annoying and bothersome. My nephew (3) ran down the halls and I had to chase him. The staff was really rude to him and us about it. He shouldn't have done that, but no need to be so rude! My sister needed to throw up and someone was in the bathroom in our private room. They were not caring at all and delayed in guiding her to a bathroom. She threw up in the toilet, but just barely. We received plenty of glares from the staff while walking down the hall to the elevator. We had to inconveniently pay at the front desk on the first floor. It took longer than necessary. There is a no smoking sign on the bulletin board next to the front desk, but you are apparently allowed to smoke on the first floor. What the heck? I can't read the Chinese caption below it, but a cigarette with a red x on it clearly means no smoking. Before I knew that, I complained to a waitress walking past on her phone. She laughed at me and told me that it didn't matter because something incomprehensible about public areas and whatnot. I DO NOT CARE. It was indoors and I do care about my health and the health of everyone else in that room filled with a cloud of smoke. I tried to hold my breath for the rest of the time and took a few gasps because it took so long to pay. The food is worth the terrible service but make sure to bring a mask with you."
124,travelbug0082,Singapore,Singapore,27-June-2017,"Our bill for 3 came up to Rmb400 which we thought was rather pricey for a lunch but this is a 5 Diamond restaurant so you can expect to pay a bit more. The food is nice and the restaurant is sprawling with 5 levels so do expect to wait a while for a table and for food to arrive. We did not get to try their huge po lo bao which comes in 6 per order as the wait staff forgot to submit the item but in the end we were so full that we would not have been able to stomach them anyway.

Their black charsiew is quite fatty so if you dont like fats, its best not to order it."

The only let down was The black roast pork is what they are famous for here but it was way too fatty. I literally had a mouthful of fat and it was sickening. The eggplant and pork mince pot was really good and the house made tofu was absolutely the best tofu I have ever had (and I hate tofu). It was silky smooth and so tasty!"

128,yingchua,None,None,3-March-2017,"Love the design & setting of the restaurant. Tastefully done up unlike many others Chinese restaurants in Guangzhou. Service could be better. Food is reasonably priced n well done."
129,emdrewl,Vancouver,Canada,13-February-2017,"Visited gz from hk for the very first time and was eager to try the Cantonese dishes here. The restaurant started calling us 15 minutes before our resos and called us again because we were a tad late (15 minutes late). It was definitely a popular restaurant with tons of people queuing so it's a must to make resos.

The menu was quite overwhelming. There were a few pages dedicated to the different tofu dishes! We ordered the fried char siu that everyone raved about. The flavor was amazing but similar to all mainland dishes, it was overly oily and fatty.

Overall I think this restaurant is a bit overrated with poor customer service."
130,Kathleen_Leong,Singapore,Singapore,2-January-2017,"Food and services were good. We ordered some signatures dishes and it was highly recommended especially they served different type of tofu and their roasted black pork was awesome. Roasted goose skin was crispy but too fat as there was less lean meat. Overall it was very tasty."
131,Dieter A,None,None,28-November-2016,"Enjoyed in the restaurant a business dinner. Good food, good selection (by my host). good and classical cantonese ambiente"
132,wongkristenp,New York City,New York,22-November-2016,"We ordered the signature lacquered pork, the crispy pork, goose intestines (surprisingly really good), roast goose, a steamed black tofu dish, steamed catch of the day, crab and vermicelli, pineapple buns and a couple of veggie dishes. The crab and vermicelli was a waste of money. For almost $40 Usd, you get a big wad of vermicelli and one crab. Everything else was fabulous. The steamed fish is a must have if you are not afraid of eating fish with bones attached. The lacquered pork is the best pork I've ever tasted in my life. I asked for the leaner part since I wanted to spare my arteries a bit. It's a bit silly that the minimum order of the pineapple bun is half a dozen but since everyone in the restaurant was ordering it, we just had to see what if they are really that good. Three adults and two kids each shared one. Ended up taking the rest home as breakfast for the next day.

The service really needs to be amped up however. We visited the Wufeng branch and the Tianhe (flagship store branch). The decor of the Tianhe branch was much nicer but both locations lacks good service and did not take any foreign credit cards. The menu was extensive but the English translation was atrocious! For a big franchise to have a menu of such poor quality is very embarrassing in my opinion. I guess the owner doesn't really care for non-Chinese diners because I doubt any foreigners would order  Soil pork potato mustard pot . It was very funny to flip through the menu as a Chinese American with limited Chinese character recognition.

Food wise, I would definitely recommend going but if you are looking for an unforgettable experience with exceptional customer service, you will be highly disappointed."
133,53leee,None,None,17-November-2016,"We visited on 14 Nov 2016 at dinner time. Ordered the blueberry BBQ pork, tofu, sizzling claypot intestines and stir fried Tainan beef. It was very tasty and the setting has a nice ambience. Paid around rmb319 and definitely worth visiting."
134,Cristina F,Hermosillo,Mexico,28-October-2016,"Service,food and place were all good! When we arrived downstairs,there was a lady taking care of our wet umbrellas, and gave us a little paper.
We went up by elevator, and were greeted by a waitress, who took us to our table. The restaurant felt like a wedding salon, with round tables and big rooms. They have an english menu so you dont have to get worry about what to order. The lady served us tea, and we pointed out which dishes we wanted, and she filled a little paper which was in chinese and didn't understand haha.
We ordered: char siew, crispy noodles with beef, crispy fried pork with orange sauce and steamed rice with pork sauce.
The char siew, this its super greasy but delicious! Melts in your mouth.
Crispy noodles: the best noodles I've had so far.
Crispy fried pork: The sauce was average, but the fried pork had a very nice consistency. It felt like crispy in the outside, but chewy in the inside.
The sauce of the steamed rice was delicious too, full of flavour.
Overall, I liked all dishes and would return here for char siew.
This is more on the expensive side for a China restaurant, but its worth it."
135,lifeelsewhere,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,22-October-2016,"Took us a while to find it but it was worth it.We did not have the exact address. Pls take a taxi with the exact address! We wanted to go the night before but was told that it was full and best to arrive 5.30pm the next day. The roast goose was so good! crispy skin and good taste! They have unusual but good dishes. Pricey place but ask for a seat with a view of Canton Tower."
136,ChinaCarolina,North Carolina,USA,29-September-2016,"The restaurant offers a bounty of Cantonese style dishes, flavourfully prepared and attractively presented. Among other dishes, we ordered a garlic & ginger roast fish, two styles of roast pork, stir-fried bean sprouts, and a lightly-fried eggplant dish. Although our pork selection was a little oily (by design) it was delicately textured and full-bodied in flavour. The roast fish in a clay (or iron?) pot was delightfully tender and infused, but not overpowered by the seared garlic and ginger. Among our party of four, one was a vegetarian and, after an initial sampling, basically fended off all other pretenders to the bean sprouts (they were that good).
Actually, the bean sprout turf war led to the only deficiency we experienced. We asked for an additional serving of the same bean sprout dish and it appears that the first server either ignored or forgot our request. After about 20 minutes we asked another server who, it appears, put in our order. Another 15 or 20 minutes passed as dinner was winding down and we asked once again. This time we were told that it was coming, but we asked to turn it back because it was no longer wanted. At this point we were told that it was too late- it would be served to us, like it or not and that we had been told that it would take 20 minutes preparation when we placed the order. Our protestations that nothing of that sort was said to us fell upon deaf ears - we got the second plate of sprouts 10 minutes after finishing our first round. Probably the rating could have been a five had this been handled a little more graciously.
Throughout dinner we observed several neighbouring tables receive platters of beautifully bronzed, puffy confections that, to our eyes looked like  bread bowls  for serving hearty soups. These turned out to be  boluo bao  (or pineapple dumplings). The kind young couple at the next table had more than they wanted and generously offered us their extras. Though they were physically large, they were delightfully light and pleasant to the eye, to touch and to taste.
We ate in one of the main open dining rooms next to a large window overlooking the street. Though the floor was busy and full, it was surprisingly not crowded or noisy as, it seems, many Chinese restaurants value. Our party were all business associates, but having a social dinner and the noise level was quite satisfactory for a pleasant conversation.
The overall price of the meal was quite reasonable for the quality and variety of dishes we enjoyed. All four members of our party (one of whom  doesn't like Chinese food ) would all return if given the opportunity."
137,aileen_cp,Singapore,Singapore,1-September-2016,"Ordered their signature roast goose and black char Siew ( requested for the lean cut) else will be overly oily. Other dishes like fried brinjal with Long beans n stuffed lotus root , tofu in Claypot , were good. The buns were amazingly pillowy soft with just the right amount of fillings ( though my friends felt they could be more generous with the fillings). We had a good view of the iconic Canton tower while enjoying our food."
138,HKG_Traveller2010,Hong Kong,None,20-May-2016,"Recommended by a friend to try their flag-ship shop at ZhuJiang New Town, and am glad that I did go. The restaurant has private rooms of varies sizes and thus offers lots of privacy.
Food is great, nearly all the courses I ordered turn out to be great; particularly their crispy roast pork fillet..... Need to try; you won't regret. Great value for money too..... less then RMB200 per person which I consider to be great value for the quality of food they offer."
139,LeeB0b,None,None,12-May-2016,"Great foo served- we have tried the brinjals - (deep fried till crunchy), fish with garlic with another new dish you have to try, fried duck and nice roasted pork."
140,zomayoyo,France,None,28-April-2016,"It's a famed Cantonese restaurant, but the quality of dishes varies between heaven and hell.

The best dish is certainly its fried rice (chow fan). Each piece of rice is meticulously wrapped with a thin layer of oil, mixed with sliced fried egg white that gives a unique mouthfeel. Its oiliness is well balanced, and the texture of rice is ideally firm. It's one of the finest versions comparable to that from Lee Garden or the Chinese Restaurant in Grand Hyatt Hong Kong.

The Cantonese chicken dish also meets my expectation. It's medium cook. The flesh is succulent. It's above average at best.

BBQ pork is a horror. Pork belly, instead of pork shoulder, is used. That's the worst cut of BBQ pork I could imagine. It feels like drinking a cup of oil. The meat is charcoal dry.

Inside the soup served in a teapot is a herd of scorpions (See my photo) which are used in TCM to sooth muscle pain and improve blood circulation. The problem is that the soup has a strong artificial Gaotang/chicken sauce flavour. It smells chemical and artificial.

Staff were nice and smiling, but threw everyone into confusion. A spoon or chopsticks or a teacup were missing in all of our table sets. Some dishes didn't come. They served us a cup without tea, then served us tea without giving everyone a cup. Don't blame the staff who worked so hard and busy, blame the management who didn't hire more staff."
141,Wilson P,None,None,23-March-2016,"The food and service was amazing, some of the best Cantonese food that I've ever eaten. Knocked down star because most of the food came out warm/cold."
142,johncque,Iloilo City,Philippines,9-March-2016,"I love how a lot of their dishes are served in a claypot. Been here twice and the food never fails to disappoint. The servers are a little bit hard to call, but once you get their attention, they are quite attentive and very professional. The menu has photos and also English text, so choosing your food is never a problem. They have four kinds of specialty roast and barbecue pork which you can combine any two in one order. Their chicken is also excellent. This place specializes in seafood and they have so many varieties. I will eat here again."
143,Syarifuddin T,None,None,8-February-2016,"Almost all the dishes here are very good. The famous pineapple toast and the french toast with barbequed pork inside is very tasty and a must try!!! Try the fresh prawns too..the waiting time during lunch or dinner time is around 30-45 min so be sure to go there earlier"
144,G7823URdanh,Torrington,Connecticut,3-February-2016,"A good assortment of traditional Guangzhou style food. All the dishes came out very quickly and tasty. Good size plates, not too big or too small. Prices are reasonable. Is this the best Chinese food i had? No but a fairly popular place that does really good business and, as mentioned earlier, tasty food."
145,alvinloy,None,None,2-November-2015,"Ambience: The restaurant is greeted by a grand entrance that leads to 4 floors of nicely decorated dining space.

Waiting time: I did not have to wait and was given a table upon arrival.

Choices: A huge variety spread across 4 menus. Prices of dishes range from affordable to above average.

Recommendations:
Once we were seated, servers pushed carts with beverages and appetizers for us to choose from.

Roasted goose: Not bad but I find it slightly salty.

Pan-fried dumplings: A plate of 15s. The dumplings are really small but tastes good.

Fried goose intestines: This is my favorite dish. I enjoy the crisp texture.

Coldwater shrimp: Tastes average which I think is due to the quality.

Char siew: Roasted to perfection: charred on the outside but still succulent on the inside. It's very good but I think the meat has too much fat to be able to consume more than two pieces.

Stir-fry Beef Short rib: Tastes average, a little too sweet.

Steamed egg with crab roe: The strong flavor of the crab roe complements well with the soft texture of the egg.

Po Luo Buns: It comes in a serving of 6. It's one of the biggest buns I have ever seen in my life. Apparently, this is one of the most popular item. Waiting time is 30 minutes."
146,kalapangha,New York City,New York,1-November-2015,"We went there around 9:30pm. All famous things on the menu like bbq pork, some tofu dishes, fried glutinous rice ran out. After planning to come here a month in advance, we did not get to try them. :( So make sure you get there early. How early? No guarantee. Maybe just go for lunch.

We could only order 2 dishes which are steamed carps in ginger and soy sauce and steamed dark tofu in gloderma (whatever it is) and soy sauce. The flavor for both of them was very delicate. But the fish has a lot of bones, not recommended if you're a Lao Wai/ Guai Lo. Wait staff cannot communicate in English but they're very attentive (when they see you call). Just like any Asian restaurants, you kind of have to get their attention , honey. Price is relatively high!"
147,Bwkuah,Singapore,Singapore,19-September-2015,"Food was highly recommended, the pineapple buns were good. Some of the shunde dishes were interesting and very enjoyable. Alas the service was so bad, big chain, multiple storeys, repeated attempts to get beer delivered, poured sauce onto my phone while serving, took forever to prepare bill and all this when we had our own private room. Convenient location near prime hotels but will think twice again. 2000rmb for 9 guys."
148,Hiroaosta,None,None,12-August-2015,"This restaurant offer good Cantonese cuisine. You can enjoy various types of cuisine. Unfortunately the service is not so good. So good to eat a friend. But the meal with customers, it is not well suited"

It was hard to get anything... water, menu, or even the bill. But the food was very mediocre. BBQ goose was not as good as I expected. The executions and colors were very lacking."

151,MinnieY_13,San Francisco,California,13-January-2015,"So they say that Bingsheng is the ultimate Cantonese restaurant in guangzhou, the epitome of Cantonese style food.

I have been to this Bingsheng like 5 times in 2 years. The first few times I was the guest so I thought maybe the host didn't order right, I simply did not find the food to be exceptional as its reputation. After hearing my sister-in-law raging about it, I thought I did give another try & let my father ordered while I host. Still no feeling of epiphany or burst of culinary delight whatsoever.

Finally host another dinner while my brother was in town. This time something clicked - we ordered really simple dishes - and the food was indeed delicious.

However, the service is deplorable for such fine dining establishment. It takes 30 minutes & repeated calls to just get a wine menu. My daughter was starving so we ordered her a simple noodle dish to temper the wait. After half an hour, the waiter told us the kitchen didn't know how to make the noodle. Huh?"
152,xxiao12,Springfield,Massachusetts,19-May-2014,"Thigh the first place for me and I'll see if they want you in your room is that ok well as much more fun with that, I think it's a bit too many times. you have to have been able the other side effects and a few minutes. you can follow us know what I want a ride with me to do something"

156,Chun pang L,None,None,15-November-2014,"It's beyond expectation that can find a Chinese cuisine preparing good quality dim sum, non oily but very crispy fried rice, Aldo you are not affordable to miss their Peking duck, which they served and wrapped for you. Even the flour wrap was put on stove to keep warm along the way to wrap, each wrap goes with every designated season and vegetable are of right portion. I seldom eat Peking duck, but the quality there really attract me take some more."
157,rhiat,San Jose,California,8-November-2014,"Had a light meal at Cui Yuan last month and the food was great. Staff was well-trained and attentive, which is refreshing after having been to several other restaurants in Guangzhou with very frustrating staff.

160,Lady_Snowhawk,Greater London,United Kingdom,10-December-2017,"Came here with my aunt in law on our second evening in Guangzhou-an amazing atmosphere. It's quite noisy because it was basically full even at 10pm but service was still super fast and efficient.

This place does basically everything, as well as some more unique dim sum choices you can only find in Guangzhou, such as Red Bean Fried Doughballs (Hong You Tiao). Everything was incredibly delicious, arrived very quickly and it was very reasonable for central Guangzhou. Right next to a big shopping centre, I highly advise coming here as it is basically open all day, since they eat so late/early in Guangzhou."
161,Alywin C,Singapore,Singapore,8-October-2017,"Our family of 4 plus grandpa & grandma enjoyed the dim sum here. We ordered most of their recommended dishes as indicated on the menu and were very satisfied with what was served.

We had to literally grab them to get any service, but the food made up for it."
162,Mei-Mei K,Estero,Florida,15-August-2016,"We walked across town from the wonderful Marriott for our second dinner dim sum.

Like many other restaurants, there are no English markings on the exterior (or interior) - this is tucked in the building labeled the Xi Yue Hui Confinement Center.

The waitresses will dig up a semi-English version of the order form once they realize you're trouble. (Note the two columns mean yes I want and no thanks.) We loved the bustling atmosphere, the tea service, eyeing what the nearby diners were eating, and the delightful presentation of the soup dumplings. All the standards were great, too--in fact, the har gow was among the most luscious I've ever had."
163,JCMY76,Singapore,Singapore,8-December-2019,"Delicious dim sum, especially the red skin rice roll and new lychee puff. Each dish cost between 16-30 yuan.

165,purple-lallang,Singapore,Singapore,4-November-2019,"We came for breakfast on a Sunday (opened at 8am). Basically one just walked up to the 1st floor and chose your table (according to your group size), unlike other restaurants where you would be guided to a table ( this was my experience at this restaurant).
The serving portion of each dim sum item is big, thus do not over order if you were only 2 pax. Ordered some of their signature items and found it average taste wise, as I had eaten better dim sum in GZ, though price wise it is affordable."
166,Paul E,Adelaide,Australia,31-October-2019,"This place was amazing. It was recommended to us by a local and I have to say, is one of the nicest restaurants that I have eaten in. The food was amazing in all aspects. We ordered (and ate) way too much but it was all so good. The staff were very obliging and we all had a good laugh with the language barrier but still the dishes were all yummy. They don't sell beer so they allowed us to go next door to the beer shop and buy some to have in the restaurant. If you do one restaurant in Guangzhou, make it this one. You will not be disappointed and the prices are just ridiculously low."
167,WeiTan48,Singapore,Singapore,28-September-2019,"Despite being a packed restaurant each time we were there, we got our table pretty quick as they have several floors with plenty of seats. We loved the great selection of dim sum items, especially the red rice roll (made of brown rice I think) that was rolled with the dough fritters. We ordered more than 10 dishes for the 2 of us, and as expected, couldn't finish them. However, we even saw another guy who came alone and ordered as much! Seems like there's a tendency to order too much, as there's just too many mouth-watering dishes to try!"

The restaurant is clean and they serve free tea which is out of this world. My favorite dishes were the sweet buns and their signature dish, which is radish tofu skin wrapped around fried crunch and shrimp, it seriously was a party in my mouth!

We ordered 13 types of dishes for 4 people (yes we ordered too much lol 10 dishes would be a good gauge for 4 people) and it only costed us RMB313.

193,Yiru Z,New York,None,15-September-2017,"I had dim sum here on a long layover in Guangzhou. Their xiaolongbao were very good, though not the best I've ever had. Other dishes were similarly better than dim sum in my home city of New York, but not as good as others I've had in more off-the-beaten-path places throughout China. Bring RMB, as they only accept Chinese credit cards and payment apps."

196,R P,None,None,22-June-2017,"I must admit to being picky about my dim sum. What they had here was good, sometimes the best I had had, but other items were only so so. The shumai were large and full of shrimp, but not as good as some that I have had that were made with whole shrimp because, although there was plenty of shrimp, it was held together by a probably rice paste that was too bland and made the shumai less delicious than I expected. Similarly, their roast pork baozi were much blander than I like. In contrast their egg custards were the best I have ever had. I think two problems this place has is its size and the fact that everything is made to order rather than being picked from a cart. As a result, you cannot see what others are ordering and follow suit according to what the locals prefer. On the plus side is that, at least when we went, the place was packed with locals, not tourists."
197,gnitiuh,Singapore,Singapore,13-June-2017,"Authentic dim sum with nostalgic flavours - folks conversing in Cantonese over dim sum and chinese tea, constant buzz around the restaurants with waiters weaving around the tables... even the slightly gaudy decoration added to the whole atmosphere.

And don't miss out on their egg tarts - one of the best I had in my life!"

The furniture and interior decoration is not so new .The waiters service is fast .but the food we order for dim sum is not really taste as good as describe it is just average to me.however the food is really from fresh ingredients .
From the highly recommendations from the net you will dissapointed....because the food not fantastic."
203,daniellefyy,Singapore,Singapore,23-December-2016,"Ate at the 盘福楼outlet: walk-able from xi men kou (Line 1 station)

The food was decent. especially the prawn dumpling and rice roll with fried prawn.

The chicken feet dish was disappointing though. not sure if that's the cantonese style.. but the chicken feet is so hard that it can't rlly be eaten.

Overall price is okay too: but the serving is quite big and only standard size: better to come in group.

Service was meh to bad: A lot could be improved on. The bill came out to 130, so we gave 2 $100 note and the waitress rolled her eyes. I don't think it's unreasonable for tourist to have bigger notes; and it's not that big either right?"
204,Guide53314,None,None,26-October-2016,"Fried menu too much oil . Clean place and good english menu. Good tea from fresh herb. On the way from subway walk on the road behind the front building see native live on the way to restaurant ."
205,zalthenu,Singapore,Singapore,17-September-2016,"Dian Dou De - which sounds like  anything goes  in Cantonese - was recommended to us by the tourism office, and we were quite happy with our meal! The staff are nice and attentive, and they have an English menu, if you so require. We appreciated the presentation of the tea, which is slightly fancier than we're used to in Hong Kong. They do the basics well, great shrimp har gau and siew mai. There are creative options too. Portions are huge though! And the price is a little higher to match.

Key point is to remember to bring enough cash. They only accept PRC credit cards and debit cards, and only accept RMB. Luckily there is a Bank of China ATM about 400m away.

To cap off the meal, we got some free snacks in honor of mid autumn festival. Sweet!"
206,trix910,Perth,Australia,10-July-2016,"We were so happy with this find! Everything was just delicious. They serve roast pigeons only for dinner and we were a bit repulsed by it but thought we had to give it a go (when in Rome). It turned out to be SO GOOD (if you look past the fact that its little head was still attached). The pink rice paper rolls with fried dough and prawns were to die for. It was really hard to figure out what was what on the menu as it was all in Chinese characters (no English menu) but we just pointed to what others had and it was all good."
207,jpy9089,None,None,27-June-2016,"The food choices are varied. A lot of dimsum to choose from. The Shrimp hakaw was commendable. Only problem is the long line and no english menu. But its always worth it"
208,Groundnuts,Singapore,Singapore,4-June-2016,"Went to this place after a search in the Internet. Was not disappointed at all. Service is so so maybe because the restaurant was packed, but the quality of tim sum was great. Thanks note the size of the item is quite large, we end up over ordering. It's a place to eat if u are in Guangzhou and near the Beijing Road, pedestrian shopping street. They don't accept foreign credit cards."
209,JamesY28,Brisbane,Australia,22-May-2016,"This is a popular local franchise and has more than 20 shops across the city. I have heard about some signature dish including the red rice cake and 4-color shrimp dumpling. My overall experiences were quite average. The deep-fried rice cake is too oily while the dumpling skin is way too over-cooked. Lower your expectations before head in."
210,uaLnoM,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,16-May-2016,"Good food long queue. It was lunch hour and we had to wait 20min for a table. I love the little hot water boiler allocated on each table. It was so convenient for us to refill our tea. Food is good. Love the egg tarts and the steam pork ribs."
211,blurqueen80,None,None,17-April-2016,"Crowded during dinner time, food served overall delicious, must try desserts as they were really nice. Recommend the prawn dumplings, pork ribs, coconut with mango. Staff service so-so though, no smile and zero interaction with customers."
212,bolobow,Melbourne,Australia,26-October-2015,"Dim sum was mediocre, but desserts were the highlight of our meal. Had better dim sum in San Fran, Hong Kong, and Hawaii. Spare ribs were so-so with tender taro chunks. Great egg tarts, almond slivers on fried milk and coconut with mango gelatin were also delicious."

This place is absolutely awesome and fantastic value for money. Clean food and environment. Good quality tea. Friendly service and divine dim sum food. As a foreigner I'm a bit picky about Chinese restaurants. As most of us I used to tend to go to western oriented places (favourite is Chez Max). I'm glad I found a place where I'm surrounded by locals and still don't have to worry about what is going to land on my plate. I especially recommend the following:
pigeon, shrimp dumpling, shanghai style dumpling (xiao long bao), coconut and mango jelly as desert (so yummy and refreshing)."
215,rydayiminlove,None,None,9-November-2014,"Highly recommended for those craving Cantonese Cuisine / Dimsum. The whole vibe, the taste and the price was amazing! Even dessert was yummy. Sharing pictures for visuals. Definitely worth the walk and the wait!"

217,Joseph S,Cupertino,California,4-May-2019,"Was suggested by the concierge where we stayed (Grand Hyatt Guangzhou) and was pleased that we could walk there. Place was relatively easy to find except that its on the second floor which was only accessible by a hard to find elevator. But that was minor.

Meal was very good. Did not disappoint. Highlight was how tea was served. There was a big copper kettle sitting on top of an open flame to keep the water very hot. When you needed water for your tea, you pour the water into these little teapots, then you serve yourself. (see pic) . It was a very civilized way of enjoying HOT tea with your dim sum.

Got there at 11:30, but had to wait as all of the first round of tables just got seated. Service was OK and food came out hot (even though some of our order was duplicated). Not a big deal if you spoke Chinese, but as with some places, English was not widely spoken, and could be a problem.

Probably 99% of the people there were locals.

Very relaxing lunch experience."

219,mcheah2017,None,None,16-January-2019,"Was told they have 13 branches around Guangzhou, this branch at Huacheng is the nearest to hotel we’re staying. They served authentic Cantonese dim sum and I like especially their ‘red rice rolls’ which I have not tried before elsewhere."
220,kareninwater,None,None,7-November-2017,"It is a great place for dim sum, price is good and dim sum is very delicious, especially chicken feet & shrimp dumpling. Many local peoples in this restaurant, several branches in GZ, highly recommend you of this restaurant, enjoy!"
221,HappyTravelerSarah,Singapore,Singapore,1-October-2017,"We tried 3 to 4 Cantonese dim sum restaurants in Guangzhou and were most pleased with this one. It is also known as  Dian Dou De  so it's best to note the Chinese name of the restaurant. They have branches in different areas so find the one nearest to your location. Just download the Dian Ping app and you can find all kinds of recommendations for food, shopping, services, entertainment and more. We like the mala brown bun and red rice rolls the most. You should have a pot of boiling hot tea to go with the greasy dim sum. The service is poor to average and the facilities like the seats are worn and carpets old so the main focus is really the food. Enjoy!"
222,NotALocalPeople,None,None,3-November-2016,"This restaurant came as a recommendation from a friend who had previously visited GZ as well as others who are GZ natives. It seems to the place the locals go. They proudly display their awards on the wall but unless you read Chinese you'll just have to wait until your orders arrive to understand why they have so many!

The food is superb and comes out hot and fast! I highly recommend the hong mi chang, feng zhua, and nuo mi ji (红米肠， 凤爪，糯米鸡)

Go with a group, drink lots of tea, eat great food, and enjoy each other's company. After all, that's the essence of good dim sum."
223,Mei-Mei K,Estero,Florida,28-June-2016,"An all-day dim sum only restaurant where nearly everyone is Chinese and the menus are in Chinese and the har gow is the most luscious we've ever seen, and the neighbors are all eating chicken feet and tearing apart miniature pigeons.

226,DerekDutch,None,None,4-May-2019,"Food was good, but for 7 pieces sashimi, 9 pieces sushi and 300 ml of sake, 2 people 280$ is not justified easily. After I still ordered room service. Price value wise not a good option."
227,EvelynneG,Melbourne,Australia,1-May-2019,"At 12.00 when we arrived there were hardly any tables filled. By 12.30 it was full. The service unfortunately was very slow even though we were there early. We had Peking Duck and that was the worst Peking Duck I have ever had and I have eaten it all over Taiwan China & Melbourne
It had so much fat in it it was dripping. I ate some to be polite as we were being taken by a supplier The Lily Buds with celery and walnuts was good and the Fried rice ok"
228,276lawrencew,Montreal,Canada,19-October-2018,"After spending the day at the Canton Fair, my colleagues and I decided not to fight the +100,000 people all leaving the fair grounds at the same time and so we took the footbridge from the site into the Westin Pazhou to have dinner.

We opted for the Five Zen5es Chinese Restaurant because of convenience and as it is in a Westin Property, we “TRUSTED” that the quality would be excellent!

Firstly a reservation is definitely needed as we were not the only ones who decided to dine at the hotel before moving on to our hotel.

The reception had a difficult time finding our reservation under my name which was not listed; but fortunately they had my Marriott Platinum Number I had provided when I called; which allowed us to be seated.

Tea was served promptly but it took a while for a simple beer order to arrive.

Even though the restaurant was filled, we did expect the staff would be prepared for it but this was not the case.

This should have told us to pan for a longer than 2 hour dining experience ahead.

Perhaps when there isn’t a huge fair going on the service is speedier!

We ordered our assortment of dishes and the soup arrived rather promptly and was both hot and spiced and enjoyed by all of us.

Next came a unique beef dish where some long beans were wrapped in a cover of spicey beef. This was also outstanding and enjoyed by all.

Then we waited for the remaining dishes that came out intermittently.

We could not enjoy having the Chicken & Pork & Shrimp dishes with the rice and vegetables on the same plate and one dish came to our table at a time!

I do not blame the servers for this as it starts in the kitchen to ensure that several dishes for a table should be prepared and served when hot & at the same time.

All the dishes were enjoyed but to dine on Chinese for over 2 hours is a lot to ask!

We mentioned the service to the manager a few times who had to come to our table and apologize for the slow delivery of the food from the kitchen.

This is definitely something they have to improve.

All In All the food served is very good but the service is lacking so be prepared!"
229,JimC321668,Vancouver,Washington,7-October-2018,"Ever heard of a restaurant that is Michelin recommended ?
Ordered 2 Appetizers plus two single portion dishes. Don’t know how to start, presentation was good, but ...
The 海蜇头 was served in a bowl, the top had no favor, the bottom part were absolutely soaked in sauce and tasted too sour.
The 熏鱼, they used the wrong fish, it has a lot of long and skinny bones. See picture.
Then came the sauté goose liver, see my plate of grease ? No need to explain further.
Finally, fish mew with crab roe, one tiny mew and “hard to imagine it was crab roe”.
Suki, the restaurant manager was very accommodating, she did remove one item on my bill. She did her best under these circumstances ! I was offered a free dessert and that was the best part of my meal.
Now, ready for this ? Someone came by my table and asked if I would like to buy a membership for this restaurant? All the meal will be half price ! Finally, puzzle solved ! Discount price with substandard food, try to fill restaurant with customers paying half price.

Ok, restaurant was not what I expected. Hotel is a totally different story. I gave it a five stars ! It is first class, quiet, clean, and top rated staff. Martha in the exec lounge is awesome ! The happy hour chef LAM is also very attentive!"
230,ArthurWang095,Taichung,Taiwan,31-May-2018,"We enjoyed too much tonight. The private dining room is great. The service is excellent. The gourmet is very delicious. We had steam fish, roast goose, spicy crocodile tail, steam egg, sautéed crab, boiled king crab, sashimi sweet prawn and assorted appetizers. We enjoyed very much, lead us drinking a lot & talking nonstop.
我們晚上太享受了，包房很棒，服務一流，每一道菜都很棒，我們點了烤鵝、蒸魚片、辣味鱷魚尾、菜蒸蛋、醬汁螃蟹、白煮帝王蟹腳、生甜蝦和各種前菜，我們太享受了，所以喝了不少、聊天停不下來。"

A great end to our visit"
235,bopsycola,Singapore,Singapore,17-November-2019,"We had a mixture of dim sum and dishes for lunch. Their serving size of the dishes was quite large, perhaps more appropriate for a table of 6 to 8. The yam basket dish was nice but the pork dish was a little tough. I preferred the dim sum. Would go again for the dim sum.
The place has three floors.
Apparently first floor where we sat is mainly for dishes, second for dim sum where you will have to take a number to queue. Third floor you do not queue but pay a little more."

Every order of dim sum we tried were delicious and my wife and me were really satisfied with our money well spent. Must tries include prawn dumpling, carrot cake, chicken feet... the list continues. Do remember to order Chinese tea to go along with your yummy dim sum. After your meal you can head down to L1 for some local delicacy to buy back home at the bakery shop with the same name."

I enjoyed watching the tea lady making our tea. The assorted pea, purple cabbage vegetable was too oily for my taste. Other dim sum tasted average.
There were many available tables at that time."

We had breakfast there on 2 mornings as we enjoyed the food and decided to go back there for breakfast again the next day.

The restaurant was huge, all 3 floors of it. When we got there, it was full and if would have to  share  tables. However, we were told by the staff that they have a  special  area on the 2nd floor where you can pay a surcharge of RMB15 and you need not share the table. Since we had 4 people in our group, we opted for that option on both days.

Restaurant was clean and service was very good. The food is typical Cantonese Dim Sum and was pretty good. Not too oily and salty. Flavour was good.

On the second day, we saw 2 guests smoking at the walkway around the central atrium of the restaurant but not observed anyone smoking at the tables. However, the smoke and cigarette smell did not reach the tables which was a big relief. Understand that smoking is no longer allowed in restaurants but this did not stop some die hard from smoking at the corridoor/walkways inside the restaurant.

Would we recommend this restaurant? (Hint - we went back again the next day)"

All three dishes were good. Will definitely go back when we are in Guangzhou."

It was almost impossible to dine here without prior booking !!! The Restaurant also boast of it's tranquil ambience with greenery all round. The dishes are mainly CANTONESE Style and the Dim Sums were supposedly BEST in TOWN!!! tHJE RESTAURANT is still popular with both the tourists and some locals. However, many GOOD Restaurants have sprung up over the years. For example, BINGSHENG Restaurant..., which has much better ambience and also offer privacy of individual room; some even with own toilet within the room!!! Try it for a taste of the History !!!"

Service is not so good but I am not here for the service but the good food makes up for it. One thing to note though is the claim where you get one free dish for every 5 your ordered - you actually need to settle your bills by a certain time, which is not made known. So I you are going for this, make sure you check with the waitress."
252,SsMmM,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,19-March-2019,"We had dinner the evening we arrived at Guangzhou and our host booked a private room. We sampled quite a number of special dishes and one most delicious dish was a three kg fish. The flesh of the fish was sliced and steamed with a simple sauce but it was very tasty. The bones were deep fried and cooked in a spicy soup. The dessert was a bun filled with walnut and cream. It was so yummy. The next morning we had dim sum again. There was a great variety of dim sum and all came in steaming hot and delicious. The price was very reasonable. With good service and good food, we are sure to come back again."

My 2nd visit to this outlet.
Ordered as per attached photos.
Wenchang Chix - award winning dish. Steam chix with liver & chinese ham. Rather cold to my preference. Chicken meat was flavorful & chewy but bland gravy. Rating 5.5/10.
Mini Tarts must be ordered in 6 pcs. Rating 6/10.
Eggplant salty & should go well with rich. Rating 5.5/10.
Goose - very fatty & oily. Skin not really crispy. Not gamey Rating 5/10. Jade Garden restaurant in TaiKoo Hui Mall serves better goose."
256,august21lai,Singapore,Singapore,1-January-2019,"This is a big scale chinese restaurant with 3 floors (if i remember correctly). We waited almost 2hrs for a table. Probably due to 31dec new year eve. We have to share table with others. But service staff is polite and friendly. The captain in the restaurant even advice us to cancel some of our orders as she thought that we might not be able to finish. My personal favorite is their luo mai gei (rice dumpling in lotus leaf). Lots of dim sum varieties and all are tasty. Will definitely come bk again if the queue is shorter."
257,Nightshade00,Singapore,Singapore,23-December-2018,"I am not a foodie by any measure but the dim sum items we ordered were terrible. The Steamed char siew pork bao were mostly bun with minimal filling that was extremely fatty. The egg tarts were cold and far too sweet. We ordered some poached lettuce that came floating in a puddle of oil. Lastly, our 马来糕 (steamed brown coconut sugar cake) was coarse and uneven and did not rise properly.

Don’t bother with the long queues, there is much better dim sum elsewhere!"
258,DetroitGKTK,Singapore,Singapore,22-December-2018,"Great dinner with family members in Guangzhou. This is a restaurant with a long tradition and history. My Mom wanted to try this restaurant.

We ordered roast goose, sweet and sour pork, some fresh local vegetables, pork ribs etc.

Roast goose was delicious. Did not disappoint. Will go back again."
259,scheepalicious,Singapore,Singapore,19-December-2018,"Let me keep this brief by listing the culinary atrocities at this terrible establishment: clearly microwaved beef noodles that appear a minute after you've ordered them; oily vegetables with tasteless nuggets of pork floating like rafts on top; dim sum that not only looks misshapen, but leaves a tannic aftertaste in the roof of your mouth (foul oil, who knows?). If you value your taste buds, flee!"
260,lightningboy,Surrey,Canada,3-December-2018,"This branch is located on Shangxiajiu pedestrian street. We arrived at 12:30pm on a Monday and waited 30 min for a table for 2. At that time, the main floor was for ordering meals and the second floor was for dim sum. There are no english menus or pictures to point at for dim sum. Luckily I know enough Cantonese to order but I can’t read it so I just named a few things off to the waitress and she marked it down for me. Out of all the dim sum we had in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou, I felt this was the best. The service was helpful and friendly, the food came quickly and everything item was very good. Reasonably priced at about ¥25-30 per dish, our 6 item lunch and tea came to ¥172. I highly recommend exploring Shangxiajiu pedestrian mall and you've gotta go to the Guangzhou Restaurant to yum cha."
261,flyeatdrinkdrunk,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,3-December-2018,"We came coz I wanted my parents to visit one of the oldest restaurants in Guangzhou. There are English words in their menus so one need not worry. We ordered the signature Wenchang chicken, sea cucumber with beef tendon n vege. Compulsory to charge you tea per pax and its not cheap. Starting from rmb15 per pax. Service rather so so. Most of the waitresses looked rather unhappy with their jobs. Food also so so. Won't visit again as nothing to shout about."
262,yuenwah,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,24-November-2018,"Heard so much of this place. The day we went for dinner, place is crowded. Were told if we want to dine on ground floor, waiting time estimates 30minutes. We decided to go 2nd floor (as no need to wait) even thou tea is about double the price per pax if compare to ground floor. Price-wise, dishes were relatively reasonable as portion is large, taste acceptable too.
Due to close proximity to our hotel, we went for dim sum the next morning. Lucky us, no waiting. Dim sum arrive some 30minutes after ordering. Food quality average, nothing spectacular. Price is on the expensive end, can definitely get better quality elsewhere for the price paid.
Overall nice environment, staff are friendly."
263,Choon87,Singapore,Singapore,10-November-2018,"Arrived at about 11.30am, waited nearly 1.5hours. Queue moves erratically and in waves. Occasionally, they may ask the crowd if they would like to share tables in private dining rooms (higher surcharge). Reception staff was rude and unhelpful, as if working there is a chore. Wait staff was more pleasant and polite.
Once seated, the food came after a 30mins wait. Food quality was good, dimsum was tasty. The price was pretty expensive though. Good for a 1st time visit but definitely not for return visits."
264,Applebananananana,None,None,10-November-2018,"Really not sure what the hype is all about as the dim sum we had was purely average. You can definitely get better ones at other restaurants say Lei Garden. Waiting time wasn't too long but service was pretty bad... Overall, would not recommend."

266,TourGuide-Guangzhou,None,None,29-October-2018,"Without any doubt, this restaurant serves rich delicacies. It has many restaurant branches in Guangzhou. This restaurant's moon cake is well-known in China. The Dim Sum and other traditional Chinese food and snacks will attract you to come back in future."
267,jaytee11dimensions,None,None,6-October-2018,"This restaurant chain delivers truly authentic cantonese food, with its yum cha menu the absolute highlight of my dining experience here (I have been to this restaurant 4 times in total). From simple siao mai to radish cakes and its braised chicken feet, everything is cooked to perfection. Until my visit to this wonderful establishment I was sure HK contained the most unrivalled yum cha houses in the world - although, given Guangzhou is Canton 'ground zero' for the rest of the cantonese population on Earth, it does make sense that the source of such an amazing type of cuisine might produce the best of its kind."
268,KiwiJake,Twizel,New Zealand,13-August-2018,"This place was a real treat to dine at. It's very authentic, in both setting and food. We loved the tea ceremony that accompanied the meal and the vast menu with helpful pictures (and English descriptions). Everything we tried came quickly, and was well-presented and delicious. We even came back a second night and it was still awesome."
269,roblu,Wellington,New Zealand,26-June-2018,"Service is professional (by compared with other restaurants), staff are very friendly.
Most of foods are taste, The down side is that the price is little bit expensive. However you may get vouchers with 10% kickback you have consumed for next time however the terms and condition apply such as only available on the weekday, no more than 50% of the total value for next cousumtions......
therefore we went to there twice."

274,Patrolf,Perth,Australia,2-April-2018,"The Guangzhou Restaurant was recommended by a good friend for its yum cha experience. A gentle stroll from our charming hotel on nearby, historical Shamian Island, over the pedestrian bridge, down a busy side street, and a right turn past the Holiday Inn, soon brought my wife and me to the huge, multi storey Guangzhou Restaurant which has been operating for about 83 years. Despite a few bad reviews regarding long waits, poor service, and disappointing food, we waited only a few minutes in the seated waiting area before our ticket number lit up on a screen. We were then escorted along with two strangers to share a large round table in this very busy restaurant. Although the dim sum menu was in Chinese, my near perfect pronunciation of our favourite dishes was appreciated by the friendly waitress. We then turned to the extensive tea menu which had English translations and from which we chose jasmine to be on the safe side...what followed was delightful: a tea set arrived, including a generous supply of tea leaves and jasmine flowers, hot water, and a burner to brew our own tea. The dim sum was good and, not surprisingly, so was the flavour of the tea. Overall, it was a memorable experience."
275,szucsmariann,Budapest,Hungary,19-March-2018,"All I know in Guangzhou, is this restaurant. It was a surrealistci one day and night vist to Gunagzhou on a business trip. My business partner took us to this restaurant, we were in a separate small room. Everything we ate was excellent, no objection. As we asked our host not to give us any spicy food, we really enjoyed the meal. The dessert we got, was phenomenal. It was a round dumpling like sweet pastry, very soft, filled with some very nice creemy thing . I have no idea what it was, but I liked it so much! Thanks!!!"
276,terrykow,None,None,23-February-2018,"I always wanted to taste the different dimsum among the places e.g HongKong, Singapore, Malaysia and Guangzhou. Finally, we had arrived to this old traditional restaurant. Old old dated decor but floated with people every early morning. I love the harmonize environment, full of local charming and passionate locals. Great dimsum i would say, my personal recommendations would be Shao Mai (pork-prawn dumpling), xia jiao ( transparent prawn dumpling), Nuo Mi Ji ( sticky rice with chicken, scallop and duck yolk), fried spring roll, fermented egg with pork porridge etc. Yummy."

Service was bad, taste had dropped and prices had shoot up. I will skip this and try others nearby if happened to be around here again. My friends who later ate at the same restaurant had the same comments."
279,nadaa356,Iman,None,14-January-2018,"Nice and clean city. The people were friday but they speak little English.

280,bakupaku,None,None,29-December-2017,"I love the Cantonese food in this restaurant, especially the braised beef tendon. Please request for private room if you cannot stand 2nd hand smoke."
281,cy_sg,Singapore,Singapore,25-December-2017,"My wife and I had dinner at Guangzhou Restaurant recently during our visit to the Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street. As visitors would know, the same street is also home to several other renowned restaurants including the original Taotaoju Restaurant but we decided to give the Guangzhou Restaurant.

When you first enter the restaurant, you would realise that it's very expansive. The restaurant is spread across several floors and there are separate dining areas so as to optimise staff allocation. On the Sunday night that we visited, the restaurant was busy but we were seated within minutes of arriving.

The large menu has English words so selecting dishes should be fairly straightforward. For dinner today, we ordered a sweet and sour pork, soya sauce chicken and a Kai Lan (vegetable dish). While the chicken came fairly quickly, the next 2 dishes came much later (as long as 30 minutes after the first dish was served). This meant that by the time that the vegetables were served, the other dishes were cold - however, this is not unique to this restaurant as we also encountered a similar situation at another restaurant at lunch.

The portions are huge. We were a party of 2 but the portions would have comfortable served 4 persons. Quality-wise, the food was tasty and generally well executed. Price-wise, the dishes were also relatively affordable and it was one of the cheaper meals that we had in Guangzhou.

All in all, not too bad for a decent Cantonese meal in Guangzhou in a somewhat traditional setting."
282,anthonyb242,None,None,6-December-2017,"Great way to enjoy authentic dumplings in Guangzhou. Staff only had basic English but were very helpful and assisted us even though we were on the late side for lunch. The dumpling were simply presented but full of flavor."
283,fireblaster,Singapore,Singapore,26-November-2017,"Decided to try this restaurant during our trip to Guangzhou. It’s along Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street just a hundred metres away from our hotel Holiday Inn Guangzhou Shifu, so getting there was quite easy.

We went on a Saturday morning for breakfast and when we got there at 9am it was already bustling. We had to wait around 45mins before we got our table. The place was rustic and set like in the old days. It had several floors and there was a courtyard/koi pond as the atrium. It was very airy, spacious and clean.

The service was prompt but far from friendly. We ordered the standard fare like steamed pork ribs, chicken feet, prawn dumplings, glutinous rice in lotus leaf, xiao long bao, steamed bun, century egg porridge, fried carrot cake, cheong fun, etc. All were very good but nothing spectacular. You could probably get the same quality at other restaurants too. It’s a nice place to drop in for breakfast if you are around the area."
284,Lynn T,San Francisco,California,25-November-2017,"We went to the one located at Zhujiang New City. First of all, the decor and facilities look tired and dirty. The dishes were worse. We ordered an expensive seasonal crab dish, what were shown to us before cooking were absolutely not what were served. Two of 5 crabs were terribly fishy (a sign of overnight leftovers). We quietly finished dinner and left as soon as we could. Wouldn't recommend this infamous restaurant to anyone else."
285,NinaAsia,Singapore,Singapore,1-November-2017,"Visited this restaurant about 10 years ago. The food then was exceptionally good, hence the desire to go there on my second trip to Guangzhou. So it was not surprising that the restaurant has become so immensely popular.

It was only 5:30pm but a large crowd had already gathered outside the door. We went to the section nearest the front door but actually we had other levels to choose from. Unfortunately, only one waitress was there. The others hadn't arrived yet. Even though the tables had filled up very quickly and we had to wait patiently for our orders to be taken, our food arrived within minutes to my utmost surprise.

Though the food was delicious, the portions were large and we could not finish.Thankfully they allowed us to pack unfinished food in containers we had to purchase."
286,philipysho,Singapore,Singapore,21-October-2017,"When one is in Guangzhou one must at least try to have one meal of dim sum. And where better than the namesake restaurant? From the outside, its an impressive old building; immediately inside, there are retail counters for local pastries & tidbits. As our visit coincided with the Mid Autumn Festival, there were boxes of mooncakes on sale. Like other eateries we visited, the restaurant gives you a menu on which you check off what items you wish to eat (so reading Chinese or having Google Translate will help!). After that, its time to tuck in & enjoy!"
287,pincpin02,None,None,3-October-2017,"Long established restaurant chain. Beuatiful place. But service is bad, maybe this is typical service level in guangzhou. Food is not good in taste, in fact very salty."
288,HappyTravelerSarah,Singapore,Singapore,30-September-2017,"We went to Guangzhou Restaurant and was awed by the scale of it. 4 levels of the whole restaurant building and there were at least 2 wedding banquets going on and many individual diners. We took a number and waited more than 30 minutes during dinner time. We ordered the roast pork (crispy and flavourful), Cantonese boiled soup ( delicious) the fried fish was bland and the mixed vegetables with squid (disappointing). We took out fried rice and char siew from another branch which was average. For the experience, it's still worth a visit to the traditional restaurant."
289,KhairuddinY1,None,None,6-September-2017,"China have lots to offer to the world. The quality of products manufactured in China are world class quality with prices however are so affordable. The only issue of doing business is the language barrier.
The business community need to have a second language ie English for better communication with business visitors."

291,JasonandNataliaR,Sydney,None,3-August-2017,"We were guest here and our local friends ordered and WOW... the service and food was great. Ten of us at a huge round table with a lazy Susan ( a lazy Susan is a spinning tray on the table so you can turn it until the dish of your choice is in front of you, so no reaching over one another). We had octopus, scollops, chilli beef, chicken, pork belly, soup, prawns and so much more and all cooked local style, what an experience and reasonably priced here too."
292,whereistheworld,Grande Prairie,Canada,28-July-2017,"My family visited Guangzhou Restaurant based on one of the 4 restaurant reviews in Lonely Planet. (there are 15,000,000 people here and only 4 restaurant reviews?!?)

We visited on a Tuesday morning at around 11:00 and the restaurant was full! We only waited a few minutes for a table though.

The restaurant is very impressive. It is 3 stories tall and surrounds an atrium in the middle. The choice tables with atrium views were all taken but I was happy to be in an air conditioned room on the third floor.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, which made the visit very enjoyable. It didn't seem that anyone spoke English, so luckily we had our handy translator app to decipher the menu.

The tea ceremony was a spectacle and made the experience so much more enjoyable. We ordered: the crab soup dumpling, BBQ pork buns, fried noodles, spring rolls, and the scrambled egg/peanut/sesame dessert.

My entire family, including my kids (5 and 6 years old), enjoyed each and every dish. The bill came to a total of 110 Yuan.

On the whole this was an incredible, authentic dim sum experience. I'd suggest a visit here to anyone visiting Guangzhou."
293,gamrerk,Bangkok,Thailand,6-July-2017,"The restaurant located in the middle of pedestrian street. Staffs are also nice, helpful and friendly. The food is also delicious and worthy. I ordered 4 dishes which came in quite big portion and I paid around 372 RMB.

I would definitely come again on my next trip."
294,KristieC202,Sydney,Australia,30-May-2017,"It was nice when we were guided to the main hall where there was a big tree inside the restaurant. The tea set was nice which we could enjoy the tea sip by sip with hot water boiling under the tray. We enjoyed a lovely dinner after shopping."

296,GuillermoM469,Auckland,New Zealand,29-April-2017,"We came here on our first day in Guangzhou hoping to find an exceptional yum char lunch. The experience was totally underwhelming. I wont say much about the language barrier because I was expecting it and I guess it is natural (no English menu and no waiter or captain speaking English). I also understand the long waiting time (around one hour) to get a table. But the problem was the flavours. I guess they were ok but nothing really impressed me that much. Indeed many dishes were kind of similar to those you can get in any average yum char place in San Francisco, Auckland or London. The problem is that the restaurant is located in the city where yum char was supposed to be born and that the place is considered to be kind of an institution. My recommendation: if there is no line go in there, get some food and enjoy the building (interesting indeed). If there is a long line go somewhere else."
297,Zenapei,None,None,27-April-2017,"The food are good and in big portion. We had the roasted goose, roasted pork, spinach and siewmai. The roasted goose is not too dry, pork was crispy at skin and juicy at meat. SiewMai is rich will prawn (and meat?) fillings.
Overall a good dinner!

Service can be improve though."
298,genar221,None,None,26-April-2017,"My husband and I with two of our teenage kids had dinner here. We stayed in a hotel across the street and could see the sign from our windows. We were seated immediately, upstairs on a balcony overlooking the koi pond. We ordered from a menu with photographs in Chinese and English. The tea was good, the food came fast. We ordered a pork dish, noodles, a soup with greens and pork ribs, and a chicken dish. They were all excellent but we ordered too much, and ate it all! Good thing there is a pedestrian street outside, we needed to walk off that meal. I'd go back there again."
299,drctan,Surfers Paradise,Australia,19-April-2017,"Paid extra 20rmb got a private room mom smoking on the third floor, great ambience, excellent tea service. Suckling pig was tasty but fat, baked bbq bun and pastry quite ordinary, beef ball dumpling ok, abalone pot was great, luqing tra was great too. Egg tart also ordinary
Service was good, they took back spinach dumpling becoz it has shrimps which one of our diner was allergic to."
300,emcm600,Dallas,Texas,16-April-2017,"I suggested this restaurant after seeing its rank and reading the reviews. I was sadly mistaken and took the brunt of the insults for suggesting it. This restaurant was a very poor choice for a business meeting.

Half of the items we ordered only to find out later they were out of. For example, they tout the suckling pork, it was sold out; the duck, it was sold out; goose, sold out; spicy beef, sold out. The waitress brought us multiple beers at once, we asked her to take one back before opening to keep it cold, her response was no. The ticket was thrown on the table and fell on the floor, the waitress told us to pick it up. The poor service and lack of menu itemsbecame the joke of the table. By the way, all of this happened during a 7pm reservation.

Bottom line I will not return."
301,ymt888,Petaling Jaya,Malaysia,16-April-2017,"Hubby and I happened to be around this area and just picked this restaurant to have dinner.Looks like an old local restaurant, typically Chinese. The menu looks old and dirty with funny translated English but at least there's English to refer to. The staff taking the order seems pleasant enough but staff interaction seems coarse and brash with them shouting across the restaurant rather loudly. Very Chinese, I guess. Food was good but the steamed fish that i ordered took very long and when enquired, it finally came out. Unfortunately it wasn't steaming hot and i suspected that it was ready a while ago and sitting in the kitchen. This is a disapppointment."
302,Alex A,British Columbia,Canada,20-March-2017,"Ordered: steamed fish, dim sums, eggplant, pie with onion, etc, some deserts.
Every dish was delicious, with its unique flavor. No excessive oils or anything of that sort.
The service was inconsistent: sometimes the food was served fast, sometimes we had to remind about the stuff we've ordered.
The facility looked clean, servers were wearing masks to prevent contamination.
Even though the service was a bit lacking - would recommend this place because of good food"
303,KYHENG,Singapore,Singapore,11-March-2017,"Came here as highly recommended by friend and we were not disappointed. Upon entering, you will be asked how much you wanted to pay for tea per head. This will determine your seat in the restaurant and I suspect the type of privacy you get and perhaps the quality of food but I am just guessing. The food is so much better than similar restaurant back home. E.g. Porridge is silky in texture, prawn dumpling is rich in taste, egg tart is flaky and sweet, even the tea taste better.

Price is slightly cheaper than back home but of much better quality.

Will definitely come back again."

In subsequent two morning, I have patronised Lian Xiang Lou and Tou Tou Ji for dim sum breakfast as well. All these three restaurants are being rated as National 5 diamonds. I am of the opinion that Guangzhou Restaurant is providing best dim sum among three of them, while Tou Tou Ji's is better than Lian Xiang Lou (not surprisingly, at 9.00am, seats at Lian Xiang were just half occupied). I have had one previous unpleasant experience at Guangzhou Restaurant, being treated impolitely at the front reception. They seem to have made an effort to improve their service standard after much negative remarks from all corners. This time, the front receptionist is not impolite but serving without a smile, little improvement indeed, right? Beside this, I am satisfy with this restaurant. Real authentic cantonese dim sum but price is up-market one. I really hope that they put in serious effort to improve their service to stay in bar with their National 5-diamond rating."

Typically a nowadays Chinese restaurant: busy and big, modern. Nothing special. The food was fine, but not great. The costs per item were of the same order as is other similar places, but ... the amount per item is really small! Comparatively it is rather expensive for what we get. I believe we are just paying for the fame of the parent restaurant!"

We ordered the 'Hiong Pin' tea which was not too strong. The garoupa (lung tan in Cantonese). The dish was steamed with black fungus and hairy gourd, very healthy. As for dessert, we tried the walnut buns. We are small eaters, we couldn't finish the buns, packed it later for supper. Overall, we were quite happy with the food at Guangzhou restaurant. Will go back for breakfast."

Dim sum was just okay - I expected it to be better considering the reputation and location but I have definitely had better dim sum even in NYC. Service was underwhelming, which I expect at these family style Asian restaurants. I recommend it more for dinner - we had a lot of people with us so were able to try a bunch of dishes from the roast meats (can't lose with duck) to vegetables to fish and they were all pretty good. Not a particularly memorable restaurant in terms of food but good enough for larger family gatherings and decent food in a nice environment."

Try the dim sum filled with walnuts and condensed milk. I am not going to forget those for a very very long time!"
327,TravelerSG1965,Bangkok,Thailand,27-April-2016,"This is an old establishment. It is a three storey building. The food is probably good 20 years ago but many other new dim sum restaurant are better now. There is a new restaurant on the 4th floor of the Holiday Inn just 5 mins walk away which is better.

The service at the Guangzhou restaurant is also not very good. So come here for the atmosphere only.

The utensils are also chipped."
328,VikingChina,None,None,14-April-2016,"Guangzhou is just 100 medeters from Holiday Inn but on Shangxiajiu pedestrian streets there are many similar places. The menu is in Chinese only so if you are picky about what you eat you might prefer a more upsclae restaurant with English menu or photos."

331,M L K,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,20-March-2016,"This restaurant has good Chinese style ambience and is busy on a Sunday morning. if you would like to dine in a room instead of the main dining hall which is a little noisy, just pay extra for the Chinese tea charged per pax. The dim sum are served hot and taste good. Overall it's clean and brightly litted. Recommended if your are visiting Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street."
332,johncque,Iloilo City,Philippines,4-March-2016,"This is a huge 3-storey restaurant in front of Holiday Inn Shifu Guangzhou and along the pedestrian shopping street. They have an English dinner menu. They are also quite popular for morning dimsum, however, there is no English dimsum menu. So ask your hotel concierge what to order and have him write it in Chinese in advance. Or, use Google translate with your mobile phone on data!"
333,serenaclaire,None,None,11-February-2016,"This restaurant is well worth a visit, as it offers traditional Cantonese cuisine. Its menu is pictorial which means you can come here if you cannot speak any Chinese."

guide us in ordering.

This restaurant is very busy. Sometimes need to Q.

The food is tasty.
steamed fish, fried rice, fried eggs, dim sum,etc.

It is near to a shopping street, good place to enjoy great food.

It is quite pricey though."

336,nikkinhuang,Sydney,Australia,27-January-2016,"This is the oldest restaurant in town and the place many locals would take their visiting friends. The food itself is always good - though not sure if it's really that superior to other well known Cantonese restaurants in the city. The decor is very typical Cantonese (big banquet hall, bright lights, huge TV screens with random broadcasts) so if you are after something a bit more atmospheric or romantic check out the Maxim Restaurant in shipaiqiao tianhe, the perfect blend of neurotic western decor and delicious Cantonese food."
337,KTD1978,London,United Kingdom,6-January-2016,"Craving some decent dim sum and found this place online. The place is seriously hectic. Get there very early in the morning otherwise you will be waiting about an hour. No one speaks any english at all so luckily I speak some limited cantonese and we had a family that was sharing our table who spoke some cantonese so he translated this into mandarin for us. Very interesting experience. The place is huge and the food is quite good."
338,LeatherTraveller,Oslo,Norway,30-December-2015,"Had a family holiday dinner at this old Guangzhou establishment Withaya group of 6. We went at about 8pm and was told that there is no more tables at the hall and need to pay RMB 15 per head to use the room. We had no choice but to pay the room fees which is not our fault. I felt they should at least offer the room FOC since it was not our fault.

We ordered about 8 dishes and had 2 blended jugs of drinks; Almond milk and corn milk which are refreshing and something new to some of us. The best dish was the clay pot baked rice with Chinese wax meat and sausages. The rest were just average and the waitress left out one of their most famous dish, the Wen Chang Chicken which is tender slices of chicken braised with a slice of ham and liver.

Overall, it is about RMB 120 per head which is above average for a similar restaurant in Guangzhou."
339,mmgegedidi,San Francisco,California,10-December-2015,"Went their for early 'tea'. Service not the greatest. You can be ignored for a while before getting any type of acknowlegement and service. Should you go. Yes. It is not just for the food - but to admire the historical background and architectural structure of this old restaurant."
340,BlueTravels,Boston Area,None,21-November-2015,"We hired a local guide for the day and this is the first place she brought us for traditional dim sum. She said that the restaurant was quite expensive later in the day but was a good value in the morning.

Not being very familiar with Chinese food, I can't say if it was better or worse than that served elsewhere, but the food was tasty and the experience enjoyable. The place was full of locals having breakfast on a Monday morning if that's any indication."
341,samanthas792,None,None,9-November-2015,"Wenchang chicken taste good, however those that do not eat liver, you must think twice ordering this dish. The chick is also tasty on its own. The dimsum has its standard, good & tasty! Love the yam cake."
342,Timothylow,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,13-October-2015,"Guangzhou Restaurant or Guangzhou Jiujia came highly recommended. Being listed as one of the The Fabulous Culinary Five of Guangzhou, I would have expectation better quality food from this 80 years old restaurant. I did not try their signature Wenjiang Chicken or any other special dishes but I ordered dim sum's most basic choices, Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow) and Siu Mai (Pork Dumpling), both were pretty dry. The steamed sticky rice with chicken in lotus leaf wrap (Lo Mai Gai) was quite bland. Fortunately their Cantonese barbecue-pork-filled bun (Char Siu Bao) saved the day, with its juicy Char Siu fillings and soft dough. Overall experience was just average and it is not a 'Must Visit' for me as I would recommend other locations such as Daishifu Road or Up Down 9."
343,milkcandies,Singapore,Singapore,23-September-2015,"Restaurant has an old charm and the service was prompt. We ordered a serving of roast goose, mince pork steamed with salted fish, winter melon soup and stir fried broccoli. The roast goose was tender and the skin is fragrant. The sauce was so good we drizzled all of it on our rice! The mini winter melon soup was also very good. The clear soup was served in the winter melon itself with pieces of seafood and mushroom in it and it was really tasty and not too salty. The minced pork was very tasty too! The portion is too big for two of us and we can't finish the food.

Our bill came up to RMB287 though that could have fed up to 3 persons. But the portions are big so you can't order more variety of dishes for just two persons.

The restaurant is not noisy and has a pleasant environment for dining. They have clean toilets too. :)"

After close to 20 years later, I travel back to my home town with my wife and 3 kids, some of my childhood friends took us around town to taste those special Chinese dishes. One of the place was Guangzhou restaurant for dim sum. I have known this place since I was a kid and in my memory that this is always a luxury place to dine. I am glad that I was able to take my wife and kids to try the food here, it really bring back a lot of memories. Many other places changed their style to more western fusion. A lot of food here in GuangZhou restaurant still has that traditional taste in it."

348,ShekouJon,Morro Bay,California,27-May-2015,"This is one of the oldest establishment dating back to the last century. The service is commesurate with local expectations for flavor, freshness and services. It is not Panda Express or what you encounter in western  Chinese  restaurants. Enjoy it and try to judge it on its own merits."
349,AndrewChoo,None,None,21-May-2015,"Had my breakfast at Guangzhou Restaurant for 4 consecutive mornings. Tried different type of 'dim-sum'. Most of them taste great. The restaurant is quite pack with people everyday and so don't expect good and fast service."
350,jojozara,Gloucestershire,None,18-April-2015,"We went to the main one (2 Wenchang South Road) which has been open since 1935. It has come on a lot since some of the older reviews. Loved the décor and we were seated downstairs not far from the large central water feature. The menu is now in English as well as Chinese and also features big clear photos. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming and spoke good English. The food was delicious and very reasonable - the whole meal for 2 only cost about £18 including tea. A word of warning if like us you are new to China - dishes here are designed for sharing and we ordered far more than we could possibly eat even though it was only 4 dishes - one meat, one tofu, one rice and one vegetable. The food was good quality for the price. Lots of unusual things like lily flower, pumpkin and almonds. All in all a great experience and I would certainly recommend this place."
351,YXQ_YSK,Ipoh,Malaysia,17-April-2015,"We had one plate of smoked fish, cha siew, egg with pricked veggie and one soup.

The smoked fish that was supposed to be one of their specialty was nothing impressive, while the egg was bland and soup too salty.

Only the cha siew was decent.

The waitress lied that the soup came in a small serving but it was otherwise and proved too much for two of us.

Then they wanted to charge RMB 10 for a plate of chopped chilli.

When we called for the bill, they ordered us to the counter to settle it.

This is one restaurant where service does not exist."
352,AprilMalaysia,malaysia,None,2-February-2015,"Not worth the price as the food is below par. Even the highly recommended Wengchang Chicken. We relied completely on the waitress for recommendation as we do not know Chinese. The person who took our order keeps rushing us and did not do a good job. We ended up with big portions eats when there's only 2 of us. And we were like grazing cows as each dish comes with lots and lots of not so tender greens!"
353,FrancisK636,None,None,24-December-2014,"This is a traditional 5 star restaurant which serves very good Dim Sum for breakfast and chinese dishes for lunch and dinner. They are very popular for roasted goose."
354,Franstela,None,None,22-December-2014,"It is a place I always take my guests to go. I love dimsum and most of types of dumplings. This is a very Cantonese traditional dimsum and it's used to have long queu in the weekend morning."
355,CodyYew,Singapore,Singapore,21-December-2014,"Had a late dinner at this restaurant today, at their branch at Ti Yu Dong Road (体育东路).

When we arrived at 9pm, we asked if it was too late for them to accept our group of 20 (11 adults and 10 kids). They agreed, and seated our group in 2 separate tables of 10 each.

Service plunged the moment we stepped in - the restaurant manager was EXTREMELY UNHAPPY with our presence, pulling a long face throughout. Neither she nor her staff wore a smile on their faces.

To be fair, the food was tasty. It was unfortunate that the kitchen had run out of most food items on their menu, including the basic dishes like tofu and eggs. Or at least this was what we were made to believe.

Portions were thin but tasty.

Tea was an exorbitant rmb15 per person. If you do not want tea, a minimum of rmb8 is imposed on each person for drinking water (regardless whether u consume this water or not!).

The restaurant looks reasonably posh and inviting. The food as I mentioned earlier, would have been a pleasant and satisfying meal. However the service was deplorable!

Apart from putting up with their sour faces and bad service, we had to put up with comments such as:
1. (When food was served wrongly to our table) you will be fitting the bill for both tables anyway, so it doesn't matter who is going to eat it!
2. (When serving food to our table, one service staff said to another in an audible tone) looks like we won't be able to finish our work and go home tonight!
3. As we were towards the end of our meal at 9.45pm, they started switching off the lights in the dining hall. At 10pm, we were told by a junior staff they they were going to clear the table regardless.

My point is this - if you think that it's late and the staff aren't able to attend to our orders, pls just say it at the start. It's not like we took our own sweet time to order our food. In fact everything we ordered was either not available or not on the menu (eg a simple sunny side up!).
When we asked the restaurant manager to tell us what was available, she pulled a black face and unwillingly inter-com the kitchen.

Anyway, long story cut short : service is really bad, especially at the end of the day.

As we left the restaurant, we were SHOCKED to see that the table cloth was flipped over onto the table setting. These table cloth were long - almost touching patrons' shoes. The same tablecloth is then flipped over onto the table setting - how filthy!! Take a look at my pictures to see for yourself ..."
356,LeatherTraveller,Oslo,Norway,14-December-2014,"Just across Holiday Inn Shifu is one of the oldest restaurant in Guangzhou still fame for its Wen Chang Chicken, smooth slices of chicken steam with a thin slice or Chinese ham and chicken liver. When eaten together, the combined taste of the liver, ham and chicken is a nice balance of sensory sensations.
Pad RMB 600+ for 6 dishes for 6 pax which is a great value."
357,Tom Y,Las Vegas,Nevada,6-December-2014,"I heard so much about this restaurant that I decided to check it out. The restaurant had supposedly won awards for fine cuisines. Been a avid food advocate, I would search out great food. This one kind of left me disappointed simply the hype had not come up to my expectation. It is just a it above average, but not that good. I've to better dim sum Places.
Even their highly acclaimed Wen-Chang Chicken was not outstanding. Still it had decent dishes but visitors need to reset their expectations.

The place was clean, service was average to below average. Price was OK"
358,yanyany2012,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,27-November-2014,"Everage food (which I expected more).
Prawn dumpling skin very thick and not juicy.
I can hv better  Lao sa  bun in kl.
cheong fun - very starchy.
Fried carrot cake - acceptable
Siew mai and pork ribs- these are one of the best dish that I had in this restaurant.
Braised chicken feet- not nicely braised , still very tough.

Probably due to high recommendations also, previous trip to fo shan with very good and authentic dim sum therefore, disappointed with this restaurant."

The roasted pigeon was small, service was bad and they charge quite expensively as compared to other restaurants. Most people go because of the established name. However the tastes are just average. The roasted pork had only a few slices on a super large plate. All portions are relatively small as compared to other chinese restaurants. The morning tea was good though and the dim sum very nicely done. The taste was quite good though the braised chicken feet tasted bland."
365,bigwaverider9,Hayle,United Kingdom,6-June-2014,"Visited this restaurant on a China day tour from Hong Hong, booked via British Airways Holidays.

This was the highlight of the tour and after travelling into China for 5 hours to visit it was a let down. Very authentic, but the dim sum and other dishes were not as good as similar in HK.

All I can say is I have had dim sum in China."
366,ChrisRHilton,Surabaya,Indonesia,23-April-2014,"One of the best Dim Sum restaurants in Guangzhou. Awesome food and price is very good. Clean, simple, and easy for a nice Cantonese weekend Dim Sum Lunch (but no Dim Sum for dinner).

However service is quite poor and no English menus or English speaking staff. They are a volume driven restaurant, lots in and lots out... so dont go expecting good service. :-)"
367,lillies2012,New York City,New York,11-April-2014,"The food at the resturant was great. Very authentic. I had the roasted pigeon which was just delicious.

Con is that non of the resturant staff spoke English so it was a challenge communicating at times but most the menu is in Chinese and have pictures so ordering wasn't really much of a problem.

Would go again. Much cheaper than going to the hotel."
368,Andrew_Alin,Greater Adelaide,Australia,7-March-2014,"We ate here twice during our recent visit to guangzhou. Once for lunch, and again for dinner the following night.

The dimsum here is pretty good, with an extensive choice of offerings, food arrives quickly and piping hot, and prices are reasonable.

The dinner a la carte options are over-priced, and nothing we tried stands out.

This lack of consistency in food quality disuades us from another visit..."
369,HKPANG,Ipoh,Malaysia,21-February-2014,"I heard this is the best in guangdong dishes. Went for dinner at 5:30pm 21st Feb. Cheapest Tee Kuan Yin cost Yuan 8/pax. If you have 10pax they will charge Yuan 80.
Weird egg tarts and chix pastry must be 1/2 dozen. How to digest 12 pcs with 3 dishes for dinner. Mind you 2 pax. When you requested for take away they will charge yuan 2 for plastic box.
Weirdest so called original Cantonese since 1935 has Singapore fried noodles.
Nothing extraordinary but expensive. Ambience is average."
370,Jon C,Wilayah Persekutuan,Malaysia,2-January-2014,"Ok, I'd admit it was good in 2010.

But on my recent travels there, likely the chef has been poached somewhere else. I spend more than a thousand RMB for dinner, and expected good dishes. Only the fish was at par with Cantonese cuisine. Rest of the dishes you can find elsewhere. The lobster sucked big time.

During complaining, even the Captain agreed that the food was below par. Then she went to check with the chef. I don't understand why she'd check with the chef when she'd already agreed it's below par.

Instead of knocking the lobster dish out of the bill, they apologized with a complimentary fruit platter, in which the watermelons were tasteless and the oranges were sour. Crap. Typical Cantonese attitude of not giving a damn and trying to make a fast buck.

Yes the ambience is ok. But we come here for food quality, and we are willing to pay for it. It was good, but not any more.

If you are planning a meal here, I'd suggest you give this a miss. Really crap"
371,ReneeReview,None,None,18-December-2013,"Lovely ambiance with an abundance of affordable dim sum offerings. Come to see how traditional tea is served. This is their main location."
372,Magdalo1,Lapu Lapu,Philippines,11-November-2013,"I actually went during Chinese New Year where they had a special seasonal menu. It's a little intimidating if your Mandarin Chinese is rudimentary like mine is, even the Cantonese I picked up didn't help that much, but it's a restaurant and they know why you are there. It took a long time to seat us, but I later found out that the delay in service was because they were looking for an English speaker.
The waitress sat us down, and took the time to explain the menu, as well as the specials.
The food was outstanding, best Cantonese restaurant experience I've had."
373,Marcus F,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,13-July-2013,"Very lovely ambiance! Love the design inside the restaurant with a small pool in the center. Food is good but It's a bit pricey compared to other restaurants.

It's located at the famous shopping street, ShangXiaJiu, south road. Well air-conditioned place, especially after a hot morning / afternoon stroll at the shopping street.

If only they could keep the air-condition running after the last call for lunch order at 2.30pm, otherwise fantastic!"

We are here for another week and a half and we will never go back. The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We had to actually stand up and get someone to serve us. The Chinese clientele did not seem to have a problem getting served. We were ther with our Chinese daughters the newest of which has a severe and open cleft lip and perhaps that was the problem. We try to always be extremely polite and in thinking back I don't remember doing anything untoward during the evening."
378,Steven881,Ontario,Canada,23-December-2012,"We have our best dim sum and chinese cuisine here. However everything in Chinese from menu to staff speaking only Cantonese or mandarin. We came here for breakfast and later for dinner. We were very happy with the food both times, excellent and the service was first class. I would rate this as a must for all that enjoy fine cuisine and very affordable too. The restaurant looks grand and majestic with beautiful 3 level views. A great place for fine dining."
379,LOTRing,Singapore,None,29-November-2012,"I understand this was an award-winning restaurant and was looking forward to visit - at any cost. I must say that the cost was definitely very high (as expected) and the standard disappointing. We ordered some of their famous dishes. Other than the roasted quail (best dish) the others are rather bland. The roasted goose was not well marinated (not sure if it was intended this way) and nothing compared to the one we had at Maxims Palace in Hong Kong. It seems that the chef wanted to bring out the original flavour of the food and thus not much seasoning was used. I would have rated this restaurant higher if the price reflects the food and service standards.
Service was quite bad. They have so many waitresses and captains but no one pay us much attention e.g. we had to ask them for rice - 3 times - before someone brings them over. The waitresses tried to avoid eye contact and each dish is served by a different person. They could reduce the no. of staff and thus reduce the price..."

I had great expection before going this place as it was rated as China top 4 ..., and of course i was dissapointed after trying the most famous dishes. Smoking was prohibited in this restaurant but there were smokers all around and the restaurant was not making any effort to stop them."
382,CMMAK,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,31-October-2011,"This place has been my favorite place for a few years since I started to stay in the Holiday Inn Shifu. Besides being near the hotel the food served is very authentic cantonese. The unfortunate thing is that, if you cannot read chinese, it is an distinct disadvantage.
Dim Sum starts at crack of dawn (730am) and the queue will peak at around 8am to 9am. On weekends, be prepared to wait for at least 30 to 45 mins. It is a good idea to go very early. The Chinese people will enjoy their breakfast for at least 3 hours!!! Some will sit there until lunch time to continue lunch !
It is an experience and it is a must to try!"
383,Jocelynnloi,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,10-November-2019,"Feel great from the moment you step into the premise. Warmly welcome and excellent service provided. No need to queue to be shown to a table. A personal waitress is there to serve you through the meal.
You can choose the type of soup base you want and also the level of thickness which iis not available in Malaysia.
The food is good and we have a great time enjoying the meal and most of all the world class service that they provide. A place everyone should go if you like hotpot"
384,ionutdragomir,Bucharest,Romania,27-April-2019,"In the vibrant Beijing street, surrounded by history and shops the HaiDiLao hotpot is the perfect restaurant to try a Chinese special cuisine. Easy to order (they have a tablet with full details) and full recommendation for foreigners. If you take also a spicy base for soup a coconut milk drink will help. Try as many types as possible for the complete experience! Enjoy!"

386,vorakornc,Bangkok,Thailand,19-June-2018,"I went in at 5pm hoping the queue would not be too long, but I was really wrong about it as there were already 140 queue before me. The restaurant locate on 5th floor of what seems to be gold trade mall on lower level, if you are on pedestrian road you have to come to the side alley look for  hi  sign and take elevator up to 5th fl.

Once there, you will be greet and given queue by their host who don't speak english, though most welcoming and did try his best to tell me the wait will be long and that i can go shopping first. I came back about 1 hour later to find out there are 60 more queues to go, so I decided to just wait. I was directed to waiting area with free snack (didn't know what they were, so didnt try), some kind of sweeten drink, and paper with origami instruction.

It took about 2 hours for me to get a table. Once seated, I got a tablet to place order. With good recommendation from one of the waitress who can speak some english, I ended up ordering tomato based soup and spicy szechuan soup along with tofu shrimp ball, marble beef slice, 2 chinese veggies and house beer. Then I get to make my own dipping sauce, which seems to be the most fun part as there are over 30 bowls to choose into my mix. I ended up looking like an idiot walking back and forth cannot decide, and the same waitress came running to help make special sauce that will match what I ordered. The sauce consist of 11 different ingredient, and it tasted great. In the end, I also made my own sauce, but it did not taste as good. The waitress came back to help cook the food and talk once in a while. Overall, it was a good meal and good experience too! If I wasn't by myself, probably would have enjoyed it even more."

The food is fresh and high quality (but Beijing is better) Please noted that the queue will be so long in the evening, so pls prepare your time. (there is a games, nailed painted free service while you are waiting) We love it!"
391,fireblaster,Singapore,Singapore,26-November-2017,"Tried out this restaurant after reading rave reviews about it in Tripadvisor. We arrived at 4pm not having any reservations. We were told any later and we would have to wait quite long before we could get a table. There was a waiting area for customers where we could sit, play some board games and were provided complimentary drinks and tit bits.

Once ready we were ushered to our booth. Very comfortable and plush seats. We were given aprons to prevent our clothes getting stained by the splashes from the hotpot. They even gave us covers to protect our bags from getting splashed.
There was a wide variety of set meals to choose from. We had two soup bases – herbal chicken and tomato. Meats comprised of chicken, pork, prawn and fish. Crab sticks, fish balls, enoki mushrooms, etc. A server also did a kind of performance while stretching the handmade noodles.

The service was excellent. The servers were super attentive and prompt. A server even went to the extent of helping us de-shell our prawns as and when we cooked them (wearing disposable gloves of course, to ensure proper hygiene, so no worries). They greeted us whenever we went to and from the toilets.

Whilst the meal was just a hotpot meal and the food was nothing really fantastic, the quality, overall experience and treatment from the staff was a refresher from all the other places we ate at. In terms of value for money, do be prepared to pay a bit more. You should try this place at least once if you ever visit Guangzhou. And make sure to come early."
392,YUIEZ,None,None,25-November-2017,"Love Love Love Haidilao. This restaurant has the most amazing sichuan hotpot I’ve ever tasted. Impressive service. If you are coming for dinner, it might take about 2-3 hrs wait to be seated."

394,HappyTravelerSarah,Singapore,Singapore,30-September-2017,"We went to quite a number of Chinese restaurants in the 10 days we were in Guangzhou. Hai Di Lao offered the best customer service from the moment we stepped in to the waiting room, table and even the restroom. There were staff serving you with paper towels. The service was attentive and prompt. The food selection was not great but definitely sufficient for a sumptuous meal. We ordered a double pot with chicken soup and mala soup. The only complaint would be the MSG level in the flavourful chicken soup. Just too good to be true since I have a reaction to over strong levels of MSG. Nonetheless we had a great meal experience. Try their brand of beer which is newly launched and taste quite good actually."
395,yanananas,None,None,27-September-2017,"Definitely a must visit for hotpot lovers. Fresh food and exceptional service. Staff are friendly and attentive to the customer needs. All orders done via iPad and food is served in a brisk. My favorite soup base - tomato👍"

Special shout out to 2 of their staff, Yang Yan Qing and Zhou Jia Xin, for being extremely attentive and going all out to ensure my dinning companions and I had a pleasant experience. I enjoyed it so much that I visited the restaurant twice in 4 days !"
397,577svetoslavt,Varna,Bulgaria,22-April-2017,"For Europeans this will be unbelievable adventure in Chinese cuisine, but I advice you to visit with Chinese friends that can guide you.
The place has only one disadvantage - you have to wait for a table and least 40 min, if you have not reserved in advance."

399,rcharit,Frankfurt,Germany,25-December-2016,"We have visited the place last year and came back today once more. It is in a shopping building, the first building on the left once you enter the pedestrian zone of the Beijing road. A modern facility with a young team and they always find a English speaking waiter to serve you. The process need to have some experience , but definitely worth eat. There is a enormous variety , and my suggestion take things you are comfortable with. We can advise the shrimps and the pork, bat all the rest is also delicious. They asked as how spicy should the chili sauce be and when I ordered the regular one we got it really spicy. We were 2 people - 3 different vegetables , 3 fish and 2 meat plates so that we could hardly finish, and paid 300rmb."
400,Melissasaw,George Town,Malaysia,24-August-2016,"First time here . Good service , variety sauces , advise to call up for reservation or take a number before . We came on weekday . Take a number . Waiting around 2hrs . Ramen made on the spot by the master . Good taste . Will come again ."
401,Hay L,None,None,25-June-2015,"This restaurant earns a fame for its excellent service, which began when we followed the long queue to wait to get in. There was a waiting area for hungry customers to enjoy snacks and drink for free.

Food quality was above average, better than any other sichuanese hotpot place i've been to. Staff were very attentive and served what you wanted sometimes even before we asked.

Don't miss dancing noodles - great attractions for taking photos, movies, post it online and show it off on Facebook.

At the end of the dinner, we left 20 yuan as a tip which is very unusual practice in China. Staff chased after us to return this tiny little money and smilingly refused to take it. The manager said,  no tip no tip. We will be 'more' happy to see you again than take this tip.  -- they really try every way to make customers happy!! Brilliant!!"
402,Long M,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,26-December-2014,"This place serves hotpot. Mainly 2 types of soup base - spicy and non spicy. You can have either one or both.

You choose what you want from the menu. However, salad and fruits is self service from the salad bar.

Since it is self cooking, there is little variation in taste, unless you want to drink the soup.

What is the main attraction is they are open 24 hours. So, you can eat round the clock... provided you don't fall asleep, and how much you can eat.

The crowd can be really pack. So, you either book a table or go early to get a table. Otherwise, you may end up waiting. And waiting can be really long. To compensate, there are board games for you to play, whilst you wait. Some were so engross in playing board games, they may forget about what is their purpose of coming to this restaurant."

411,534sonyah,Mumbai,India,30-October-2017,"One of the best (if not the best)hotpots I have had. Visited the place with some local friends, who did the ordering for us. You might find it difficult to order if you cant speak Chinese or do not have a local accompanying you. They have a huge variety of meats and vegetable to add to the hotpot and their sauce selection is commendable too. We even had them home deliver a hotpot once. Was a delight, both the times."
412,Jo T,Ashton-under-Lyne,United Kingdom,11-September-2017,"What an evening we had here! Despite most of the staff speaking no English - they were super helpful in terms of making sure we knew what we were doing (choosing our meats, cooking the dishes, adding sauces etc). We ordered the noodles, and as part of this we got a special noodle show, which was very impressive! And I don't know if we were there on a special night, or it's a normal thing, but we also got a show from a traditional opera performer - the elusive changing masks! We did have to wait about half an hour for a table, but during our wait we got given free drinks and snacks, so we didn't mind at all. And it was worth the wait. If you're not really into spice - do NOT get the spicy broth! Stick to the plain or mushroom."
413,Heather M,None,None,23-May-2017,"We loved it! Service was fantastic even though they were very busy. They have many choices of broth to choose from. All the food was very high quality. No one spoke much English, but it wasn't too difficult."

People we lined up, sitting stools waiting to get in! We had a private room which was very nice but I miss the hustle and bustle of the main part of this very large restaurant. The service was fantastic and they looked after us very well. The menus of meats, seafood, veggies etc. was extensive and very fresh. The spice pot was nuclear and the broth pot was flavourful. My lips and tongue felt tingly after the first couple of pieces. Excellent experience and they had a welcoming platter made up as well!"
415,Wendyzhou,Sydney,Australia,26-March-2017,"I made a reservation however there was some confusion and we had to wait 30 mins. Other than that, everything was flawless. The service is amazing.

I am Chinese to begin with and I really do not know English. So I have to speak to them in English. I do not like this place and even though the food was served. I ask for cold water on one person and they told me straight up no we do not serve cold water. Wth no cold water. Sigh well all the review seem so positive I wish I was born white"

418,Remarx,Singapore,Singapore,8-December-2016,"This is easily the best service attitude and execution I have experienced in any restaurant in China. Clearly delighting the customer is a ingrained culture in this establishment. Apart from this many little useful complimentary services are catered for. USB phone charging and convenient little shelf to place phone below tabletop, plastic ziplock to avoid getting soup on your phone, cold towels on arrival, slip on overall to protect your clothes etc. On departing the receptionist not only helped us to take our photo but offered to instant print a photo for us. Oh and the food was fresh and delicious."

The environment was so great that I couldn’t help falling in love with in. The waiter was enthusiastic. this restaurant gave me an excellent first expression. After our seat was allocated and ordered dishes. The waiter recommended us some kinds of dishes. And we only waited for a very short time. We got our dishes. The taste was special and beyond comparable. It was different from all the other hot pot restaurants I have eaten before. And most importantly it wasn’t expensive. Lots of family can afford it. So I make this comment and recommend HaiDiLao to you, hope you can have a nice dining experience at HaiDiLao too."
421,660jm,New York City,New York,30-October-2016,"We came almost 830 pm yet the place is still busy as usual and the same like any other HaiDiLao.

This branch is located in beijing road pedestrian street. We reached there at 6:30pm and the restaurant was already 70% full. We ordered four different types of soup base (brace yourself to face high level spiciness if you order the   Ma La  soup base. I would recommend tomato soup and seafood soup. Meat and vegetables are all served fresh and there is a counter for serving fruits and to make dip sauce .

Price (in my opinion) is a little on the high side but it is definitely worth trying. 5 star!"

We left the restaurant around 10:00pm and it still had a crowded waiting area so its super popular.
The hotpot is really good and we also had a small noodle show in the room which was really nice.
The service is impeccable!!"
427,Orange83,Ipoh,Malaysia,4-April-2015,"You really have to be very patient, as we waited for almost one hour for our turn, but treated we some fruits, snacks and drink at the small table beside the restaurant.

Pot of vegetables with shrimp paste is also good"

We've been invited by a Chinese client, that lives close to this restaurant. I really like Chinese cuisine, but some of my colleagues doesn't and they really enjoy it.
The vegetables were amazingly cooked, raw like the Chinese know how to do, but incredibly fresh and tasty.
But the five star dish was a lobster in a spicy sauce... Super!!"

Dim sum overall 6.5/10."

These Yum Cha restaurants are usually crowded from 6am till 11am. You have to endure the long queue there.
However there is another Chinese Restaurant that serves good dim sum in the CBD Tianhe area ie Jade Garden Restaurant. It belongs to the Mei-Xin Group Hong Kong. It was founded in 1971.
I came early & got the  1st prize  = queue No. A1 or 1st customer on queue.
Well, I tried the most expensive Dim Sum in a cage,  Char Siew  bun,  Cheong Fun , assorted fish paste in chilli & taufu.
As you can see the attached photo Dim Sum in a cage consists of 6 items for 2 pax. Baked Tart with African abalone came last with 5/10. Others were 7/10.

Taste of the soup had quite a strong pork's smell, and the wantons in the soup were pretty tough and undercooked.
The serving of the sweet potatoes' leaves was huge for 2 of us, and the taste was just average.
The crispy chicken was good but was a little dry.
Garoupa belly was just normal, couldn't taste out a feel of the fish.

Price was rather on the high end, considering that you can get better food in other places in Guangzhou.
But with such a setting and its atmosphere, it could have better service considering the number of waiters and waitresses the restaurant has.
Nonetheless, it was good enough. But slightly costly, could have gotten better food elsewhere but definitely not without such an ambient and setting."

If I’m being brutally honest there was room for improvement in some places but I would recommend highly. Big thank you to Alunsha and the team for the incredible meal!!"

Since I was staying at MO, I went there for the dim sum lunch, food and service are all good as expected!"
461,galacticnick,Singapore,Singapore,12-September-2019,"I have to say Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou probably has the world’s most discreet elevators. The staff at the reception must be amused by the daily sight of clueless guests and visitors circling around the lobby looking for the elevators and the buttons (which are even more difficult to spot).

The signature dish, roasted Wen Chang chicken with flaxseeds, is predictably outstanding. And the deep-fried black swan shaped dumpling with goose meat, carrots, black fungus and onion filling is a delightful surprise. But the same cannot be said of the rest of dim sum and desserts, which are by the way extremely photogenic (Instagram worthy). While they are not inedible and in fact, rather tasty, they fall short of the expectations one would have of a two-Michelin star restaurant. The lobster filling in the lobster roll for instance is overcooked, giving it a rubbery texture.

Also short of expectations is the service. The vast majority of wait staff were unfortunately dour-faced and robotic, with the exception of Long Lin (I hope I got his name right - he was the only one wearing a white long sleeved shirt and vest during the lunch service on September ). This young chap was earnest and enthusiastic in his service, taking the trouble to introduce every dish that he served, including the ingredients. He was also the only one who bothered to find out my name and address me accordingly.

Jiang is by no means a bad or average restaurant, but compared with Jade River at White Swan Hotel and Lai Heen at the Ritz (both one Michelin star restaurants), it needs to up its game in terms of its food and cuisine. It after all has two Michelin stars.

By the way, if you’re paying by Visa or MasterCard at an international luxury hotel chain, be prepared to be DCC-ed. You won’t be asked if you’d like to pay in RMB or home currency. I suspect the machine is programmed by default to charge you in your home currency at criminally horrendous exchange rates. It happened to me last night at the Ritz and today at Mandarin Oriental. Unacceptable!"
462,Kshf_C,None,None,5-May-2019,"On the third level of the Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou, Chef Fei’s Jiang is a stand-out in a city full of recommendable Chinese restaurants. Prices are high but not exorbitant, considering the already high prices in most upmarket restaurants. Recommended."

464,Jacob T,None,None,12-January-2019,"I want to make it clear that this is based off of an expectation of a Michelin star restaurant.
Upon arrival we were sat in a basic dim-sum dining hall with no music playing, harsh lighting, and an overall lack of decor.
Tea and the tea service were great. Wine selection was fair - I thoroughly enjoyed my Australian semi-dry Riesling and a NZ Pinot noir.
The menu is very big, with lots of options.
We ordered several dishes.
Cherry foie gras was great, probably the best dish of the evening, but it lacked any local/regional flair.
Seafood and lotus root patty was good, but oily. It came with a tacky sweet chili sauce that was unnecessary bc it overpowered the main part of the dish.
The sweet and sour pork was so bad that it felt like a mistake. I was hoping it would be elevated, but was comparable to a typical American-style take out dish.
Lobster soup was good.
Char-siu was fair, but really nothing special.
Scallop and asparagus dish was fantastic. Finally a dish with regional flair and surprising flavors. Cooked to perfection. This entree was the only Michelin worthy dish we had.
The scallops were followed by a highly disappointing noodle entree.
I'm missing a couple dishes but the rest were disappointing.

Overall not worth it. Not sure how they have a Michelin star."
465,grahambolt98,DownEast and Acadia Maine,Maine,23-July-2018,"A creative fusion of styles from various regions.....presented with a fusion of western fine dining. Presentation of the dishes is excellent, the food amazing, and the regions represented means you can make a gourmet tour of china right at dinner....I especially like the Szechuan beef!!

Service is very good, if available ask for one of the side ‘booth’ style tables, offers privacy and romance if there for something special.

It is fairly expensive as you would expect for its location in one of Asia’s top hotels, but it still ticks the key ‘value’ box given the quality of food and service."

467,Azntiger,Honolulu,Hawaii,19-February-2018,"Our last night at the Mandarin was spent dining at Jiang by Chef Fei. As we were in-house guests, we were greeted by name upon arrival and taken to a beautiful table (booth).

Congratulations were once again offered (see my review for MO Guangzhou). Much to our surprise, the assistant Director of the hotel’s food and beverage department appeared at our table to welcome us and make his recommendations. He also took our order!

Everything that we chose was delicious and beautifully presented! The staff were so kind and nice and at the end, presented us with a beautiful dessert of a bird cage (made of sugar) with two custard tarts with two pieces of deep fried coconut that were shaped like birds! Too much for words!"
468,180ivenl,None,None,1-September-2017,"Flavour is not the only thing that chef of this restaurant. Plating and presentation of all dishes can only describe by one word, Elegant."
469,Smoltman,None,None,1-April-2017,"Had a business lunch at this hotel restaurant and they were serving Dim Sum. The service was impeccable and the offerings of dim sum was expansive. Chicken feet, carp soup, shrimp dumplings, crab rice, greens, plus numerous more items made it a very enjoyable experience!"
470,PaulHollis321,London,None,22-January-2017,"We visited this restaurant on the 31st of December for dinner arriving around 8.40pm. Keep in mind throughout the review, this is a chef and restaurant that one day hopes to get Michelin stars! On arrival we came out the lift and there was nobody around, so we waited for about 5 minuets and eventually a member of the restaurant came out the kitchen carrying some food. They stopped briefly to acknowledge us, then said  Wait here . 10 Minuets later we were still waiting, and the waiter came out to say they were just getting the table ready! The table was booked 2 months ago, and when we did get shown to our table after 15 minuets of waiting in the corridor (with no offer of a drink at the bar, or somewhere to sit) the dinning room was mostly full of empty tables anyway!! This was a terrible welcome to a 5 star hotel and restaurant...
After the initial poor welcome, the service got better, and our young waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with the Cantonese menu, pointing out signature dishes and explaining them well. We decided on 3 of his recommendation including the mixed BBQ meats, the pigeon, and the goose in black pastry. A few minuets later our waiter came back to inform us that unfortunately the kitchen had not communicated with him, and they had run out of the mixed meats, and they had no pigeon!! Very disappointing again, especially as we had spent the last half an hour choosing.. We returned to the menus, and ordered a few other dishes we liked the sound of (the time was around 9.15pm). As we had no idea on portion size, so I checked with the waiter to see if we were able to add to our order later if it was not enough, to which he replied, no problem. The dishes that followed were all really well cooked, and the goose in pastry was a particular stand out dish! With all the dishes arriving in quick succession (including the main course before we had eaten the starter), I decided to order one more dish before dessert, so called over our waiter. He then informed me the kitchen team had gone home so we could not order any more food (around 10.15pm). I was so surprised at this I asked him if it was normal in a 5 star restaurant for the chefs to finish before the customers? He then went on to explain that Chinese chefs wont work longer than there hours, and they had set hours and they had all finished, shocking!! I asked if there was any possibility of dessert to which he disappeared off, and reappeared about 15 minuets later with what he called a mango mousse. This was basically purred mango with a bit of cream, as nothing from the menu was available because the chef had gone home!!! It was a nice gesture, and the young waiter did his best to put things right, but unfortunately there is no way you can recover this blunder other than give the whole meal complimentary, and even then you would still loose your Michelin star if you had one! They even turned the music off at one point during the evening, as if to say its time to go home, and I had to request they put it back on! This restaurant has allot to learn if they want to compete on the top level, and that was cemented the next day when we visited Ming court in the Langham hotel, which was perfect in every way.
The food is good if you arrive early enough before the chef goes home, the service was poor ( although our waiter did well under the circumstances), value for money was poor, and the room had no views and a poor atmosphere which is why I scored it poor overall... Cost was £240 GBP for 2 people, and we left still hungry, so a very disappointing dinner!!"
471,young26,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,25-December-2016,"Assumed a restaurant in such refined hotel like Mandarin Oriental would live up to its reputation. Service was top notch in the quiet corner hosting eight tables. Food was way off the mark. Roast goose was cold & tasted like duck. Abalone was fine yet lacked finesse. Poached crab meat asparagus again served cold. Stir fry beef noodle without any wok flavour. Definitely better alternatives for Cantonese cuisine in Tianhe without paying exorbitant prices."
472,CocoDuke,Paris,France,30-July-2016,"After five times in this Cantonese restaurant, Jiang by Chef Fei at Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou is the place to go if you want to spend a typical nice lunch or dinner in a warm atmosphere.

On the main dinning room or on the semi-private alcove (booking recommended), you can taste very delicious and very well presented dishes such as roasted goose, steamed rice with black truffle, various types of dumplings (a special menu is available), salmon sashimi or egg tart. The special tea menu will brighten up your order.

In addition to the details mentioned above, this review cannot be finished without recognise the very high level of service. Indeed, the director of food and beverage and his entire team pay a deep attention to their guests' wellness in order to pamper them as much as they can.

In conclusion, for a special occasion or just for the pleasure of a nice meal, do not hesitate to try this restaurant at least once during your stay at Guangzhou, you will not be disappointed.

A French regular guest of this luxurious property,
#MOfan!"
473,CJSinScotland,Scotland,None,26-June-2016,"The restaurant is in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. We booked a table but were ushered into a private room which felt a little strange with just the two of us. The service was very good and the food was excellent. They were a little unsure about the wine and had to get the bottle we requested from another restaurant in the hotel. The drinking soup in a little teapot was delicious. The Sweet and Sour Pork was presented in an amazing way and the Beef with Chillies was hot but amazing. The selection of desserts is worth ordering just to photograph it but is not as tasty as the savoury dishes. It is expensive but we were not shown the set menu and we only saw this as we left the restaurant. Overall we had a very enjoyable meal."
474,Amusa A,London,United Kingdom,19-April-2016,"Food was not very nice got advice not to try the chinese food there, but decided to try,lobster cost about ¥1800 which is d most expensive anywhere in d world ,soup was cold and not tasty,had to return it twice,also missed an order we ordered then they said the cook had closed ,for a 5 star restaurant,worst I have seen,been coming to china for 14yrs,worst food, but customer service super,my opinion stay off d Chinese restaurant."
475,January28,None,None,11-April-2016,"We dined at Jiang by Chef Fei in mandarin Oriental during a family trip in Guangzhou. The dishes were all flavorful. The abalone tart was delicious! For dessert we had the fried coconut milk with hasma dessert, simply divine!"

477,grahambolt98,DownEast and Acadia Maine,Maine,4-February-2016,"I have eaten at the restaurant on several occasions, both for business and for personal dining pleasure. The service is perfect - from attentive and helpful in the main dining area (ask for a side booth - cosy and comfortable) to attentive yet private for the business meals I have hosted in the private dining rooms. The private rooms vary from small enough for a 1 on 1 dinner, to larger scale business meals. I have used for single gust through a group of 8. I would expect their service quality to continue even with larger groups.

The food selection is superb, with a range of local and regional dishes - all with a contemporary style and presentation. Ingredient quality is excellent (for those concerned with the quality of the various meats in the dishes), and the seasoning shows a respect for the fundamental taste of the ingredients, not by over seasoning.

For me, I particularly enjoyed being able to mix a variety of regional dishes, as well as to try some very traditional local Cantonese items.

Wine selection is good, yes is pricey - but most decent wine in China is! At least here you are sure of a well kept bottle, served appropriately - unlike many restaurants in China.

So overall - an excellent restaurant for both business and personal, with the usual very high standard of Mandarin Oriental service. Well worth the visit, and a regular (and reliable) destination for me.............dinner there again next week!"
478,Priscilla T,Kangaroo Island,Australia,14-December-2015,"When you're next in downtown Guangzhou, treat yourself to an amazing meal of contemporary and traditional Cantonese food at this gorgeous restaurant. Swan shaped dumplings; chicken shaped meringue; quail broth served in individual pots; melt in your mouth beef fillet; flavoursome steamed chicken. Just some of the delights..."
479,SueLynnTiong,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,15-June-2015,"Jiang by Chef Fei in Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou is said to be one of the finest Cantonese restaurant in the city. The menu is large, featuring Chef Fei’s specialties comprising seasonal ingredients – some prepared according to time honoured traditions and some, created by Chef Fei to tease and delight your palate.

The interior is very tastefully designed, using grey, brown and cream colours to create a modern and sophisticated feel. Service was attentive, though English speaking guests might have difficulties communicating with the staff. The languages spoken here are mostly Mandarin and Cantonese, both of which I’m hopeless in.

My sumptuous lunch began with the Royal Kung Fu soup, made using wild chicken and longan. This was served in a teapot and consumed as though one is sipping on tea. I loved how flavour packed the soup was – savoury, aromatic and sweet from the longan. Xisha Island Crayfish with Cheese Sauce was delicious, to a point I still salivate at the mention of it. The crayfish was sweet and succulent with a firm texture, while the cheese sauce gave it a rich, decadent flavour.

I enjoyed the Homemade Beancurd with Abalone Sauce, served with lightly cooked broccoli pieces for crunch and flavour. I asked for a bowl of white rice to enjoy this, along with some stir fried dou miao. Jiang by Chef Fei does a pretty good roast pork belly – meltingly tender with crispy skin and tasty fat. The roast goose was also pretty decent, although I wished the skin was crisper. That said, I liked how Chef Fei managed to flavour the meat with its fat, so it was tender throughout.

Wenchang Chicken (a Hainanese specialty) is popular at Jiang; you get to order it poached or roasted. I opted for the latter because I like indulging in the crispy skin. But traditionally, it is best enjoyed poached, said to contain nutritional values for good blood circulation. From the dim sum selection, I liked the steamed rice rolls with crispy fritters and shrimp. This was well prepared, combining different textures – smooth, crispy and springy. The hark au and siew mai were commendable, but mushroom bun with foie gras filling was disappointing. There was too much bun to filling, so I didn’t get to taste much foie gras.

I like how Chef Fei plays with food presentation, like the pan fried goose and radish dumplings that was shaped like a swan. Also too cute to eat is the deep fried rice ball with Chinese frog jelly and coconut milk, shaped like a duck. This was a tasty treat where the centre is creamy and smooth from the jelly. If you’re planning to visit, I highly recommend calling ahead to reserve a table as it can get pretty crowded during mealtimes."

482,Ithakatraveller,Melbourne,Australia,4-April-2015,"Jiang by Chef Fei was highly recommended and as it was conveniently located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel where we were staying, it seemed a great opportunity to try it out.
The food was good, but we would have appreciated the option of a banquet-style menu for a table of seven who wanted to sample the best of the best. Service was friendly, but there was not much guidance regarding food selection. I found the final bill very overpriced for what we got, though another reviewer has commented on the price of wine, so this may have been a contributing factor (I did not see the breakdown of the final bill).
In summary, an ok experience, but not one I would seek out if I were not staying at the hotel."
483,Chun pang L,None,None,15-November-2014,"It differs with most Chinese cuisine that less oil, smaller portion, less salty, and appears differently. The design of cuisine also fusion with Northern Chinese and Western sensation. Staff service was great and warm and sincere care.

487,PFirst123,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,13-April-2014,"Good food, fine ingredients and nice ambience. I really like this restaurant for the high quality of food. However, they could have hired more matured and better trained waiters. They are like little kids from college, and service, of course, was compromised. Very pricey for full meal, but they have good deal for buffet dim sum. I'll be back to try the dim sum if I ever visit this town again"
488,amazingtripsasia,Switzerland,None,9-March-2014,"As expected from a Mandarin Oriental, this restaurant offers excellent food and the service is just impeccable. This restaurant is a must when visiting Guangzhou, Cantonese cuisine is authentic and also offers some regional Chinese food as well. I can safely say that among all five star hotel Chinese restaurants, this beats them all hands down! Try their dim sums as well, not a very wide selection but each superbly prepared!"
489,Madona0035,None,None,31-May-2018,"Despite the name of the restaurant says ‘Noodle’, the restaurant also serves other type of dishes, which are ShanXi style. If you are a noodle lover or meat eater, this will be the right place. The noodles are freshly hand made, you will be able to watch the chef to prepare the noodle from the scratch till being served. One of the signature dishes ‘Marinated Pig Bones’, can make some eaters ‘mouth watering’ the moment you see it. The spring onion pancake is absolutely delicious too...For every pensioner who eats in the restaurant will receive a bowl of complimentary congee (rice in soup). For vegetarians, you will find the limited but tasty dishes from the menu too."

492,LaoBlue,Port Deposit,Maryland,24-June-2013,"Been here very often, and the food is very reasonable. Taste is good and quantity very fair given that prices in Guangzhou have risen steadily over the past few years. Noodle soaps are great with choice of noodle type. Good sized pieces of meat, but make sure soup is very hot because meet in China needs good solid cooking if you know what I mean. The dumplings are wonderful too and a good price! Lamb is available too.
Go early because it gets busy. Also look for the newer restaurant by Aeon/Jusco store (East Railway Station) on the basement floor.
Hint: go on your birthday, but bring your ID to verify your birth date. Get the big bowl of birthday noodles! Wow!"

And the service is impeccable. I’ve been here several times and on my most recent visit the kitchen prepared a special dish for me when I gave them my favorite ingredients - lobster, mushrooms and noodles. The result was the best meal I’ve ever had in China. I can’t wait to return over and over again. It’s a wonderful restaurant that is the top of its class."

497,michaelt238874Y,Singapore,Singapore,21-December-2018,"We’d visited Lai Heen for lunch on a Sunday after reading all the good reviews about this restaurant.

The interior decor caught our attention - there was a pond, gentle flowing water and a bridge that gave the impression you have moved from a garden into someone’s home. Quite unusual design.

We’d ordered the set lunch which appeared to be of good value. The dishes were served at a good interval without being rushed. Of the eight dishes, I like the truffle Siew Mai and the fish porridge (without bones, which was very impressive).

Staff were attentive, they replaced our plates a few times with clean plates and refilled the tea cups. When I mentioned that I didn’t like the spicy taste of the salad, the manager returned with another plate of salad with Japanese dressing.

The Executive Sous Chef Aiden came to our table to ask for our feedback. We were surprised to meet the Chef and told him we were impressed with the food.

Service was excellent and attentive. The manager Candy He was very kind to give us some travel tips on where to visit and how to get there.

We hope to return when we are next in Guangzhou."
498,Chinsfurrie,Singapore,Singapore,15-December-2018,"Read about this restaurant from the Michelin review and decided to give it a go. Among the dishes, thumbs up for the side mai with truffle, a must try dish. Next dish which I like is the prawn dish and the porridge with grouper fish. The service is excellent. After getting feedback that we didn't quite like the salad which contains chilli oil, they remade another dish with a different sauce to replace it. The chef even came to get feedback. Very impressed with their service. Will definitely come again."
499,sharonybl,Petaling Jaya,Malaysia,30-November-2018,"Everything exceptional about this restaurant, from the decor, to the service, to the food. We also had the opportunity to meet with Chef Gordon., whom recommended some melon soup, dim sum, peking duck and siew yuk (roast pork). Everything was sooooo good for lunch that we came back for dinner that very night.

The peking duck is excellent and the siew yuk was the very best there is. trust me! our family has eaten a whole lot of siew yuk and we even do make our own. Chef Gordon's was the best! .. and do ask for the XO sauce. (the food taste great on its own but the XO sauce was just too good to say no). We had the peking duck and roast pork again! for dinner plus a few other dishes and desserts (mango sago cream is a must!)

p.s. and thank you Ms. Candy and assistant for the most attentive and friendly service, Mr Matthias Vogt and of course Chef Gordon."

502,MMFrance,Bordeaux,France,18-November-2017,"We were there a few years ago it was great. This time, everything was terrible.
We did pre-order a Pekin duck, it must have been the first time she did cut one, did not know from side to begin, tried and tried and tried then made too big parts, took 15min to cut, everything was cold!
For the rest of the duck, they just cut everything with thy eyes bones, in thy side kind of restaurant you expect à more delicate cuisine.
At the end, 20 minutes with nobody showing up, they were prepared for the next day, nobody cared about us, no offer of dessert...
Unbelievable for thus kind of restaurant, pass your way."

504,philang2016,London,United Kingdom,29-October-2016,"This restaurant is a complete rip off. The menu is totally deceptive and for a very ordinary meal for 4 we ended up being billed over RMB7000! To put this into context the next day we had a much tastier Thai meal the with more food that was way tastier and which came to RMB 300. It is a disgrace that Ritz Carlton can allow a restaurant that completely cons its customers and with such abysmal service to operate in its hotel."
505,ahafen,American Fork,Utah,22-April-2016,"We enjoyed an amazing dinner here last night. Pork Belly was outstanding but honestly everything was great, pecking duck, shrimp... Chef Gordon is very talented and personally came to thank us for coming to the restaurant. Yee Liu (the manager) was gracious and kind, her  welcome tea  was a special touch I will not forget. We come to Guangzhou from the USA each year to attend the Canton Fair, I expect that we will now come for dinner at Lai Heen every visit."
506,RedRocksPhoto,Denver,Colorado,2-April-2016,"THis is definitely the high-end way to enjoy Chinese cuisine in a very classy way. Chef Guo is extremly talented in fusion style cuisine. I was told he traveled extensively just to expriment with the choices. This is not a typical chinese restaurant. The setting is very quiet and elegant, and the food is not served in typical chinese way, but a very unusual multi-course presentation, with individual portion for a spactacular tasting experience. Highly recommened for a romantic/formal Chinese diner (sounds interesting? It is, indeed!)"

We had around 6 ladies all over our table at all times. My Jasmine tea was filled every time without me asking!
Food, here is where 8 dropped points... It is average... Don't bother asking for the peking duck... The crepes are not so good, thick, sweeter than normal and cold! The waiter that cut the duck was a novice! Too bad for a restaurant this  fancy . Other dishes were simply average...
We had a lady playing a traditional Chinese cord instrument that was quite nice... The place is clean over all.
Will stick to the buffet downstairs.... It is quite good and lots of choices."
510,AnnaliseinLondon,London,United Kingdom,24-December-2014,"I visited the restaurant last friday and found the food and service to be just ok.

Service: The food took an unacceptably long time to arrive given the restaurant was not even half full! waited 45mins for dimsum and another 45mins for dessert! We were in a hurry and ended up having a 2 hour lunch.

However, the waitress serving us was very polite and tried her best to check up on the food.

Food: I expected better quality dim sum. The char siew pastry had too much pastry and the pastry itself was too thick. The custard buns we had for dessert again had too much pastry and not enough filling. Also, the custard filling itself was too salty and should have been a bit sweeter.

Overall portions were too small. For the value i would not dine here again; there are other much better options in Guangzhou."
511,Thankfulguestny,New York City,New York,30-October-2018,"I was disappointed that the food quality fell way below what the reviews in tripadvisor indicated. All of us were really disappointed about the quality of the food. Very average. I was hoping to write a good review but unfortunately the food quality was below expectations. On the positive side: service was very good. They tried their best to deliver good service. But the food quality couldn’t compensate."
512,ChrisRHilton,Surabaya,Indonesia,21-May-2018,"Have been there countless times, and is simply one of my favourite restaurants in Guangzhou. Always great food and very attentive service.

The duck, together with the sauce and vegetables was delicious. The half duck was enough for the two of us, but if you are a big eater, you will need a full one."
517,Patsy_L5,Singapore,None,23-April-2016,"Anyone who is in GZ HAS to have at least lunch in this amazing restaurant. Service is excellent and the food is simply delicious. Pricing wise, it is more expensive than the normal dim sum restaurant but worth every cent. The English name of this restaurant is Lei Garden. Have tried their branches in Beijing, HK and Singapore. All good but this is the best. (In pricing too)
The hotel helped us to call in advance to make a reservation for lunch. 2 sittings - 11.30am and 1pm. Also, you have to order the Peking duck in advance too. We didn't know on our first visit so we made another trip there the next day. No regrets cos its that good.
Our group of 3 ladies had plump chicken feet in abalone sauce, turnip puff, char Siew puff, rice crackers in lobster soup (we had half portion but it's enough for 6 persons), half a roast goose, soup dumpling in superior stock, steamed Teochew dumplings. For dessert we had mango pomelo and almond milk. If you are wondering why we had so few items over 2 consecutive days, it's because most of the items were so good we just had to repeat them(left out the rice on 2nd day). The Peking duck, in my opinion, is good but I'll skip it to save tummy space for other dim sum items.
There were many other items we wanted to order but just didn't have space in our stomachs! Special mention must go to the pastry Chef. The turnip puff simply melts in your mouth. As I'm writing this, my friends are still thinking about it 2 weeks after our trip! Order anything on the menu is that is baked by the pastry Chef and you won't go wrong.
This is one restaurant that will make me go back to GZ anytime! Be warned though, once you try their dim sum, it is difficult to find another one that is as good as this and you wouldn't want to dine elsewhere!"
518,JufinDoha,Doha,Qatar,11-February-2016,"The peking duck was very good. The restaurant is a bit expensive. We spend over 900 for a whole duck, vegetables one side dish and one dessert with sime thea and 3 beers. It's a short walk from the mtr and located in the IFC building on the 4 th floor. A very nice dinner for our last evening in Guanzhou."
519,ecwlin,Westwood,Massachusetts,12-December-2015,"Food was consistently good as was service. We had dim sum. Their XiaJiao (steam prawn dumpling) has some of the thinnest wrapping, and the prawn was fresh and tasty. Their other dim sums are also very good. The tea has such great fragrance and taste that lasts and lasts - usually only good tea has fragrance and taste lasts. Its more expensive but worth it."

I had a little information about this restaurant, but the navigate  Ms.Cao  kindly introduced all the great food, and i really enjoyed them.

Not many dimsum can be served in the dinner. For dimsum, better to have lunch."

528,AGK_CR,Santa Ana,Costa Rica,2-May-2015,"I visited this restaurant because the reviews in Tripadvisor, unforttunatelly I went alone so I could not taste many dishes as I would have liked. I tried 5 different dim sum plates (these were the only ones available this day) but they were amazing all of them. It seems they have a large menu of dim sum, I don't know when they have all the menu available, but if you are looking for Dim Sum, this is defenitly a place to visit, just find out first if they have it available.

The other items in the menu also looked very good, but I did not try them. A chinesse couple seated next to my table told me their crispy pork was the best dish they had tried in this restaurant and recommended it to my, however, after 5 dim sums, I had plenty.

The menu its in english and the staff was able to help me in english as well.

This restaurant its very easy to get to even by metro, you exit the Zuhiang New Town, metro station, Exit B1 and from here its a 5 minute walk. Walk south on Huaxia Road, maybe 2 blocks, Cross the street and walk towards the Opera House, There is no signs, since the restaurant its in the 4th floor of an office building. From the entrance of the building you see the opera house, this is the best landmark I can offer.

This is a great location to walk around, this is as beutifull as modern China gets. The buildings, the architecture of the neighborhood its amazing. You are also minutes away from the river.

So allow some time to walk after dinner in the neighborhood"

The restaurant is noisy with loud music which is their signature style."
537,KodoDrummer,Yekaterinburg,Russia,11-February-2017,"Although the dining room is very large, seating hundreds, even with our 1:40 pm arrival, we had about a 15 minute wait to get a table. Certainly this is a sign of great food. The overall price I thought was a touch on the pricey side. However, the portions are large, and we did take home a plastic container of food.

It was a nice touch to get our change in a LukShow Money Pocket (photo attached)."
538,Hburn10,Singapore,Singapore,2-January-2020,"Came here 5-10mins before service ended at 2:30pm on Christmas Day and the staff was more than accommodating to sit us and explain that we have to place our order soon as last orders were up.

All we ordered were delicious! Chicken feet, siu mai, beef balls, beef cheong fun, xiao long baos - all good. Service was also great given that we were 'intruding' when they were just about to close - we did not feel rushed at all. With the Marriott Bonvoy 30% off, the 2pax lunch came up to about CNY225 inclusive of taxes.

A superb deal given the quality for sure."

It was not even a busy Saturday a.m. We chose this place as it was open for breakfast by 8:00 and we have an afternoon flight to catch.

Food wise, it’s a standard hotel food - nothing exceptional, which you can get at any hotel in Malaysia or Singapore at a fraction of the price. I still prefer a typical noisy yum cha place at 1/3 of the price. Won’t bother coming back!"
540,L3944BRbarrys,Boston,Massachusetts,6-November-2019,"The food at Man Ho is below average, the setting is dull, the food is just okay. There is a new chef and they have made some changes, but still there are so many better places to eat in Tien He. The peeking duck is reLly good, but everything else is not!! The no longer have Man Ho rice which was a favorite. It’s a hotel in a Marriott which may be the problem."

Ordered sweet corn soup - came out luke warm and very watery
Also lemon chicken - had to ask for extra sauce as what was brought was gone with 2/3rds of the chicken (which my wife thought smelled bad) left

Service - mostly interested in getting us to sign the bill and leave as we were the last ones to get served

While Man Ho in JW Bangkok and Medan have been recommended, sorry, not here. A real letdown"

545,AlbusD,Singapore,Singapore,28-December-2018,"My family of 3 went there recently for dinner and had a terrible experience.
The initial service was acceptable with service for tea and menu but the service was downhill from then.
we tried to get someone to take our orders for more than 20 minutes and despite asking attention from a few waitresses, we were kept waiting as it seems only designated waitresses can take orders.
After having our orders taken, the first dish came at a reasonable time. The second came quite a while later and it was dessert!! When asked why the order of the food was wrong, the excuse was that it was a busy evening for the restaurant.
However, after another 40 minutes, no food came despite numerous queries from us.
We decided to give up and asked for the bill for the two items we have consumed. When i offered to pay cash, the waitress suggested that we pay by credit card as it will inconvenienced them to process our cash payment.
To top it all, a 15% service charge was added for this extremely poor service.
In fact, i have gotten much better service at much humbler restaurants in Guangzhou and other China cities.
as a loyal Marriott Rewards member for many years and having been to a few Wan Hao/Man Hao restaurants in the region, i have not received any worst service before.
I'd suggest the management to review how service could be improved in their establishment."
546,ericcA6756IQ,Malaysia,None,26-December-2018,"We enjoy our meal at Man Ho. The crispy chicken and wasabi prawn was a hit. The chicken skin is so crispy and the meat was juicy and succulent. Pickled radish was so crunch the the marination was well balance. The double boiled Matsutake mushroom soup was so tasty. The jelly fish was so crunchy and from top notch quality. The fish puff with baby cabbage in superior stock was a hit. The fish puff was full of flavor and smooth. When come to dessert the mango cream with pomelo is one of the dishes cannot be miss. The mango cream is so flavorful and yet is smooth with the piece of pomelo bursting inside your mouth. Keep up the good work. The price is quite reasonable too."

550,Brusdad,None,None,16-August-2017,"We hosted a party of eight for the all you can eat dim sum at man ho. The 138 RMB per person seemed reasonable. In general, the dim sum was pretty pedestrian, we had much better elsewhere for a lot less and the service was EXTREMELY slow. Seems like they wanted to make sure you didn't eat all you could eat by taking forever to bring the food. Even getting more hot water for the teapot was a challenge. There are much better options in this area."
551,HKPANG,Ipoh,Malaysia,18-June-2017,"I stayed at Marriott for 2 nites checked in 14 & out 16th June. Tried their Dim Sum promo again. 1st was back in March 2016.
Most of Dim Sum varieties were 6/10 - 7/10 except for Wonton Noodles & Lor Mai Qai. Wonton Noodles soup was too chemically alkaline induced broth & Lor Mai Qai was bland with little fillings.
Overall 6.5/10.
I think probably better than established outlets like Tao Tao Ju, Lei Garden, Lin Heung Lau & Dim Dou Dak."

555,spencerusa,South Miami,Florida,10-March-2017,"Surprising for a hotel restaurant, the food is the best part of the experience. I would recommend the crabmeat and corn soup, tiger prawns with wasabi sauce, the Peking duck and the Man Ho chicken. Portion sizes are generous so no need to order too many dishes.

If you are a party of six or eight, there are some very pleasant booths for semi-private dining. Four or fewer and you are seated in a nondescript dining room with only two window tables and very boring decor.

The service is up and down. The captains seem competent but the wait staff not so well-trained. Twice, another table's food was brought to our able. It says something about the food quality in this Chinese restaurant that we were able to tell that it was not what we ordered before digging in.

Prices are what you would expect in a quality hotel restaurant and not excessive in my view, given the food quality (which I would score 8.5 out of 10)."

Food comes, buns and dumpling were too cold to be able to be eaten, that's so so terrible.

Recommedation - never ever comes to this place and avoid Marriot at all level! If you want to spend this much, it would be wise to consider else where."
558,Artkran T,Taipei,None,2-December-2016,"Where on earth you can find dumplings served cold in a 5 star hotel. Well this is the place.

561,Jester90210,Beverly Hills,California,3-November-2016,"I am staying at the Marriott Guangzhou and though I've stayed here before, I've never tried the Chinese Restaurant on the 6th Floor, so this evening I joined a colleague and headed down there. It was close to closing time, so wasn't crowded, and the service was exceptional. I had just worked out, so didn't want an excessively large meal and was craving Peking Duck, and a shrimp dish that wasn't on the menu (they are only too happy to prepare custom dishes for you...just let them know what you're feeling like). By the way, the regular wait staff are exceptionally friendly and professional and only too willing to help, but English is not their first language so please, please please be patient with them. If you're continuing to have a problem communicating what you'd like, just politely ask to speak with the manager (who's been at the hotel over 10 years), who will go out of her way to ensure your meal and entire experience with the restaurant is exemplary.

The decor is stately Chinese, but may be a bit bland for some. I actually loved it, but each will have his own preference.

Overall, the meal and service were delightful and I will definitely return on my next trip when I'm in the mood for Chinese."

Usually I would go to local restaurants like Guangzhou Restaurant & Panxi to experience real  Yum Cha  atmosphere. However, I decided to try out this Offer of Yuan 38 discount for guest. Buffet cost Yuan 138 - 38 per Guest.
Frankly, everything in Guangzhou city - accommodation, food, fashion etc extremely expensive.
I tried 23 different items  bamboo basket  & they were pretty good in taste (6/10) & value for money (8/10)
It has a delightful ambience with simple chinese decor & lastly very quiet.  Yum Cha  culture is very popular in Guangzhou & noisy atmosphere is common place. Finding a quiet dim sum outlet is rare."

Decided as I had some time to kill before my flights back to the UK I would sample the local cuisine in the Man Ho Restaurant within the Marriott Hotel I was staying at.

Arrived at 7.25pm and was given a seat with no fuss, sat and waited and waited. Had to nudge the waitresses to provide me with a menu, not a good start, took 15 mins in total for the menu's to arrive, ordered two simple dishes and a glass of wine.

Some locals arrived at about this time and were shown to their tables.

I still waited for anything to happen

8pm I asked where my food was to be given at best a blank expression.

By this time the three local tables were all happily tucking into their food, I was now beginning to feel not wanted and also frustrated.

I had to ask a further three times before both simple dishes arrived at 8.15pm, totally frustrated now.

Never again, the food was OK but the service levels appalling, totally appalling"
567,WelshPerth,London,United Kingdom,8-September-2014,"i am still smarting after my experience here - my children were keen to experience real chinese food in Hong Kong. the children's menu included an option for chicken noodles but the waiter brought the £25 or more dish from the main menu along with an almost identical dish of noodles. It was impossible for one adult and 2 children to eat their way through the 3 dishes ordered on the urging of the waiter who seemed so very friendly. Clearly only friendly in order to make sure I followed his guidance. My advice - yes, the food is excellent by try the restauant in Admirality"

Had roast goose and suckling pig (2-combination) platter, roast pigeon, fried pork, tofu and 2 stir fry vegetables (broccoli and lettuce). Nothing exceptional... food was really average and nothing to shout about.

Visit only if you are more interested to check out the impressive landscape - gardens, ponds... but do spare at least 30 minutes just to walk around inside the courtyards. This is really a huge restaurant."

We arrived at around 7:30 am and when we left at around 8:30 there were lots of people waiting. If you have limited Mandarin skills this restaurant is still do-able. You go to the front and they write your table number on a ticket which they hand you, each table has a relatively discrete number. The waitress asks which tea you want and hands you a menu. We took a guess at what to buy and found everything to be fresh and delicious. The restaurant is surrounded by gardens and stunning. We fed a family of 5 for less than $40 USD. I can’t wait to go back!"
571,LohKWoh,Singapore,Singapore,19-December-2018,"This this a very big restaurant. It comprises of multiple levels situated in a large property. There is a garden, multiple pools of waters and lively fish surrounding the restaurant. Should walk around the garden before settling down into one of the many beautifully decorated rooms for the meal. The interior of this restaurant is beautifully done up. Almost like an artistic place.

The food and service are excellent. Please see the photographs for the description of the food. Definitely a strongly recommended place to dine in Guangzhou."

Wonderful decor, excellent food, good service. Menus comprised mainly of Authentic Cantonese food with a few modern twists here and there.

Also contains several private function rooms if you want to get away from the noise and bustle of the average Cantonese restaurant crowd (Though you may have gone to the wrong city entirely...)

It was selected by a Guangzhou business associate, who often frequents it and was warmly welcomed by restaurant staff. The décor is very Chinese and elegant, and the food was great especially taking into account that the bill for the ten of us came in at about 60% of what I thought it would be. Toward the end of our meal the restaurant became very busy, and understandably, service slowed but was very acceptable. The servers were attentive to our needs and requests, and were very friendly.

I especially like the fried pork and rice noodles."

There were 2 pavilions, and let's try the right hand side, which the left handed one would be a reserved choice at higher spending. The right handed tea house pavilion was nice decorated with very local Guangzhou style. Most serving attendants speaking Guangzhou language instead of Putonghua. Dim sum were very Guangzhou style and cooked. Very delicious at a very affordable price. Choices of old style dim sum were not found elsewhere. Jasmine tea was very good. I highly recommend you should go to this tea house when staying in Guangzhou."

Service is iffy depending on the staff you meet. One server told us to finish a small dish of chilli sauce before asking for another for four of us. You have to wave wildly to get their attention."
583,howee2019,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,22-April-2019,"It's one of the best restaurant in Guangzhou and was rated 5 star by China National restaurant association. Dimsum and others Cantonese cuisine is the popular dishes here. This is a huge restaurant which has a spectacular view of a small lake built in the middle of the restaurant. There is one section where you can even dine on the lake while enjoying the food. Although I did not try on their dimsum this time because I pick the Cantonese dish, I will definitely come back to try their dimsum. On the menu side, English is limited but you can choose base on the pics on their menu."

The restaurant is really huge and is well decorated. No word can describe the decoration. You just got to come and see for yourself."

Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, xiaomai with a shrimp on top, stir-fried choy-sum leafy greens, and something else we tried our best not to recall, were all exceptionally lacking in taste, freshness, presentation, and texture. To deal with the trauma of our misfortune to come here for lunch, we took a taxi immediately to DinTaiFung where as usual we were greeted by smiling polite young servers dressed in crispy white linens and a promise for decently good meal."

The food is traditional Cantonese style and everything we ordered was great. The dinner menu is quite extensive and has English and pictures so it’s very easy for foreigners to order. The service is average at best. You may have to flag a server down to grab their attention, or ask a few times for something you want. But this is not unusual for this kind of establishment. The cost is a little higher than the average restaurant in Guangzhou. Overall we were very pleased with our experience at PanXi and would recommend it."
589,Blabbott,Aurora,Illinois,22-November-2018,"Service at Chinese restaurants cannot be judged by Western standards. The most important thing to Chinese is the quality of the food and here I give PanXi high marks. Even a Chinese standard dish like (Cha siu pork) barbecued pork had a flavor unlike any I had ever tasted before. The pigeon was also the best I have ever had. The prices here are high, higher than I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, but if you want to splurge for some really great food in a Chinese garden setting, you will not be disappointed."

591,Yuri_The_Traveler,Raleigh,North Carolina,6-October-2018,"Overall the food tasted OK. The BBQ Goose was good, outside of that the rest of the food was OK. Nothing to brag about. The service was terrible, it took forever to get an order and we were only 4 tables in a 20 tables building. Getting a cold beer was an undertaking. Good thing that I had a bottle opener with me, if not it will have taken another 20 minutes to get the beer open."
592,BebotG618,None,None,8-September-2018,"Good Dimsum and good service. Very reasonably priced. The tea service is a plus. Good restaurant. The fishes are carefully selected and cooked. Love their shrimp fried rice and the shrimp with gaylan stalks. Very tasty. Clean bathroom."

As usual I went there this Feb, I had been in queue for almost 25 minutes, when I was given a seat in 鴻雁廳 (Hong Wan). I found my seat was being taken, I take to the manager but was told to asked the seat arrange lady, as I do so the lady just swipe off what she wrote and told me to take any seat I like. I took the seat which the table still remains the left over of the pervious guest, I asked the waitress to clean that out but was told (rudely) that I'll have to wait. I leave instantly and wrote a complain in the reception. I hope the restaurant would take the complain seriously. All in all that was a really worst experience."
602,TMa48,None,None,14-February-2017,"Had dim sum on Saturday. Many locals having morning tea there. This place had a very Cantonese atmosphere, everyone speaking in Cantonese. Nice steamed dim sum especially har kaw & siew mai. Prawns were fresh. The red cheong fun & mah tai gor were nice too."
603,hamishclifton,Folkestone,United Kingdom,18-December-2016,"This is a very large restaurant by a lovely lake with many dining rooms. We ate in the most expensive area, on a static boat in the lake, very beautiful. The meal for four (without alcohol) was £50 and was excellent. It's a top eating place in Guangzhou. Thoroughly recommend it. I think I was the only non Chinese eating there! For the first time in China i saw sweet and sour pork on a menu and tried it - and it was goooood!"

607,eestimaalt,Parnu,Estonia,4-November-2016,"Went there to look for some authentic Chinese ambience and the great cantonese food Guangzhou area is so proud of.
The setting and premises were lovely, but the tea ceremony was half-automated, with stainless steel electric kettles etc, and the food had zero appeal. We ordered 8 different items from the menu plus a variety of dim sum bites, but were left extremely unimpressed. E.g my pork dish was basically a heap of strips of soft fat wobbly lard with some unseasoned beans and 2 small pieces of grilled paprika. No condiments available.
Yet the place was packed by locals. Didn't really get, why."
608,NetnetIris,None,None,13-September-2016,"One of the four garden restaurant in Guangzhou. Very good dim sum for yumcha. The restaurant has a long history."
609,Gourmandonthemove,None,None,8-September-2016,"Panxi (泮溪酒楼) in Liwan District is worth visiting for the beautiful garden setting and for the kungfu tea experience. The 4 star rating is for the setting and the tea experience. The food is a 3.

Ask to be seated in 中国会 （translated it means China gathering or meeting place I think) where you get your own table instead of sharing with others, with views of the lake. You will pay RMB9 per pax for the tea plus 10% service charge, which are waived if you share your seat with others in another dining hall without lake view.

For the kungfu tea, each table is given a cart with your own water dispenser, electric kettle , miniature clay teapot and cups for you to brew your own tea. A fun experience that's highly recommended!

Food-wise, to be honest, the dim sum are merely average, compared to the ones in the HK run establishments. We had 2 types of their signature shrimp dumplings, crispy cheese n shrimp rolls, steamed milk n egg white custard, egg tarts and herbal jelly with honey. All tasted ok but nothing to rave about. We were given a menu in Chinese. They have an English menu if you need one.

Panxi opens at 7am for breakfast. Get there early if you want a table. By 9+ the place is very crowded so you may have to wait for a table and we were there on a weekday."
610,Asja F,None,None,26-August-2016,"The food was very tasty, the service was good too and the place is very impressive, but we were unable to go to the toilet because we could not stand the smell."
611,Repomies,Helsinki,Finland,30-July-2016,"This seems to be very famous place for locals and tourists as well. I went there for lunch alone and was seated in the round table with two local gentlemen. I ordered pork rib salad, pork meat with chili and cabbage with bacon, three dishes were just too much. This place and food is best when shared. Also the other gentlemen were offering me to taste their seafood porridge as they were not able to eat all. Food was good, nothing special. Pork with chili had more chili than pork, spicy, but that's what I like. Maybe I should have gone for the dim sums?"
612,680ashwinb,Bethlehem,Pennsylvania,14-July-2016,"I visited this restaurant with family. We tried to make a reservation but the staff refused to take our reservation. So we head there on a Sunday morning around 10am. It was super crowded and we had to wait for our turn. Once we got a table, we ordered our food and tea of course. Their original dim sum menu is in chinese, however, they also have a simplified version of it in English ( for thoses who cannot read chinese, you can ask for the english menu). It has the pictures on it, which makes it easier to order. The dim sum is authentic and very delicious. We finally didnt mind waiting that long for good cantonese food. Definitely recommend this place for Dim Sum."
613,Christina C,Coquitlam,Canada,21-May-2016,"This is more than a restaurant
During our visit to Guangzhou, our friends took us here for dim sum. This is not your normal restaurant, it’s like a garden with trails, waterfalls, ponds trees and flowers. We made a few turns before finding our individual room that faces the famous Liwan Lake Park. Good dim sum lunch with good friends and with the atmosphere that was hard to beat, what a treat. They even have an old fashioned wedding carriage for you to play pretend and take photos.
Happy Travelling!"
614,WWTraveller26,Singapore,Singapore,14-May-2016,"This is one of the most authentic places in Guangzhou to enjoy dim sum. The tea is served at your table, the dumplings come fast, ask for the English menu. I tried all the recommendations on Trip Advisor and was super happy. The turnip cake is really nice, as are the barbecue pork bun, the prawn dumplings, the steamed greens and the sweet dumplings. My only complaint with Cantonese dim sum is that I wish they came with a spicy sauce but well you can't have authenticity along with customization. Definitely will go back, perhaps in a larger group."
615,Tonybuts,Sydney,Australia,18-March-2016,"Panxi was a lovely experience in a much more interesting area than the new Tianhe district. Helpful woman staff assisted us with English language menu and ordering. The servings are very large for two. We had peanuts in sweet vinegar to start, followed by braised clams & vegetables, thin fried noodles, and crispy skin chicken. Unfortunately TsingTao beer was unavailable so has Pearl River beer which I wouldn't choose next time. All up $A40 is hard to beat value."
616,collegeteacher,Toronto,None,1-March-2016,"This was our first dim sum experience, and everything was great. When we walked in, we were seated quickly in a dining room filled with large round tables and absolutely packed with people. We were seated at a table with a Chinese family out for brunch, which was kind of cool. We were able to take our social cues from them. We were given menus in only Chinese at first, and we tried to use our phones to translate, but pretty quickly a server saw how complicated things were for us and brought over a translated menu. We ordered a lot of the standards, including shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, garlicky greens, and sesame balls stuffed with sweet bean paste. The food arrived quickly and was presented in beautiful bamboo steamers. All of the food was yummy, and the tea was hot and delicious. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and took a stroll in the beautiful gardens on our way out. I would recommend this restaurant unreservedly."
617,Jackie_Brussels,Brussels,Belgium,2-January-2016,"No word to say for other more expensive lounges.
In the cheapest lounge (where tea is 6 yuan) the waitress treated me as a Sxxx !!
Worst service I've ever met. NO notion of client.

I fully understand that I am not allowed to bring the meal list with me. Want to try everything, I just put ALL the meal numbers I ordered on a sheet of paper. The waitress didn't let me to do that. In addition, she considered me as an idiot and gave a very stupid answer:  Next time you come, just ask one of us to order something for you .
==> Why should I ask help? I can do it myself.
==> In such a pricey restaurant, how can people order dishes randomly ?

The way I was treated is NOT acceptable, especially from this kind of luxurious restaurant

It is more easy for me to write this comment in English, than in Chinese. I really hope that the management will read it and take actions !!"
618,thomast220,Singapore,None,1-January-2016,"Panxi is one of a handful of traditional courtyard style restaurants in Guangzhou. The service as terrible as any other yam cha establishment in Hongkong. Food was decent but some arrived a little cold. Eating at Panxi is really just about an experience and the view of the lake and the beautiful triditonal architecture."

It's a chilly day but is food supposed to come out warm almost cold, even congee!! Restaurant is famous but Dim sum here is underwhelmed and overrated. All dim sum places we went in New York are much better than here and even cheaper. Menu is in English with pictures. Staff is helpful but can't speak English. Lake seems to be under construction. Architecture is beautiful."
623,WWTraveller26,Singapore,Singapore,25-August-2015,"As with the best dimsum experiences, there is so much variety and quantity that it's best enjoyed in a large group. Their house dish, assorted fungus is quite nice as is the award winning Chef's creation, taro and cheese, though the latter is not Chinese at all. Cantonese dim Sum is a little dry and bland but the taste is in the juicy stuffing, I am told. Worth an experience to eat on a lake in the middle of a busy historical district."
624,Hiroaosta,None,None,21-August-2015,"This restaurant is located Lizhiwan park. So there is Chinese style pond inside of restaurant. You can enjoy good Dim Sum & Chinese classical landscape. There are so many customers in weekend morning to enjoy YamCha. You should accept to wait."

628,qasr,canada,None,12-July-2012,"Came here upon the recommendation of some locals. Dignitaries stop by here too. Busy place, can be tough to get a spot, but service is fast. Food was not too bad. Greasy, but it's Chinese food. Flavourful, and the dim sum was good. Highlights of this restaurant are it's picturesque albeit manmade setting. Like visitng old China with the lanterns, bridges, fishponds. Take time to walk around and take photos."
629,Edyharto,Singapore,Singapore,25-June-2012,"Panxi Restaurant translated into English means `half-west' Restaurant. But in reality it is fully packed most of the time and a fully-stuffed complete Chinese Restaurant. Besides the many varied kinds of delicious dim-sum with wonderful names, there is roast meat, roast goose and roast suckling pig which are sold at a stall beside the restaurant.

When we were here in March 2012, the restaurant was over-packed with people coming here for their morning dim-sum breakfast. They did not have a waiting list. This time in June 2012, the crowd were still packed but we were allowed to be kept on the waiting list. But the wait was too long, so we went across to the neighbouring restaurant, which was similarly packed but still has rooms for the three of us.

We ordered the usual dim-sum, sieu mai, har-kow, chee-cheong fun. But we could not forget the suckling pig and we went across to buy RMB 84 worth of the delicious stuff. It was great and I think at value-for-money too."
630,David H,Sydney,None,17-April-2012,"After failing to get a seat last time we were in town, we decided that Panxi was on our must do list this trip to Guangzhou.. What a disapointment, food was terrible, didnt match what we ordered or what was shown on the menu, was gluggy and felt like it had been reheated multiple times and worst of all we could walk 20m down the street and eat food 20 times nicer and cheaper.

If you want a nice meal in Guangzhou, try Guangzhou Restaurant, Chau Kee or pretty much anywhere else. Panxi was obviously a wonderful place in days gone by, but presently it is a sad shadow of its former self."
631,bapbap,None,None,19-November-2011,"One of the most famous restaurant in Guangzhou. Good food in a nice atmostphere."
632,jojojojojojojojo,Reno,Nevada,17-August-2011,"If you are in Guangzhou and you want a taste of local cuisine without all the weird stuff, in a beautiful setting in old town Guangzhou please stop by the Banxi Jiu Jia for one of the best hidden locations in Guangzhou that will both impress and fill your stomach. The location is set in old town Guangzhou surrounded by a lake and low-rise buildings, definitely a hidden treasure amongst the concrete jungle. Getting there by taxi is the best choice, but if you take the subway get off at the Zhong Shan Ba Station (Line 5) or Chang Shou Lu Station (Line 1). (Website with map and fare calculator: http://www.gzmtr.com/en/)

The telephone number for the restaurant is --. Call to make a reservation. If you have a Chinese friend who can call for you this is best, and for larger groups you can reserve a lake side private room if you call a few days in advance. The restaurant is usually packed for morning tea on Saturday and Sunday mornings, offering a delicious selection of local dim sum but also award winning Cantonese cuisine.

Check this place out, it's been famous with the locals in Guangzhou for a long time and I hardly saw any other non-Chinese at this venue. It's a hidden treasure and well worth the experience for a nice Sunday morning out on the town and a treat to find such a pleasant setting in a busy city.

Outside of the restaurant there is a street with other Cantonese local offerings, such as tea and mooncakes (now that they are in season). It's a quick 5-10 minute walk up the street but there are items here for sale that are really truly Cantonese in nature. It could make a nice gift to a Chinese friend or colleague not from Guangzhou as the offerings here are authentically Cantonese."
633,ModernDayMarcoPolo,On the move,None,24-July-2011,"Banxi is one of Guangzhou's oldest and largest restaurants. Unfortunately it is now past its heyday. The menu is pricey and many of the most interesting items were simply not available on my visit.
This area of town is interesting now that it is being refurbished and I would recommend a visit if you like Lingnan style, but I would choose another one of the myriad places to eat here"
634,Meander589124,None,None,18-November-2019,"As the birthpalce of Cantonese cuisine, Guangzhou is one of the culinary meccas of China.

Also a very good location on ground floor of Canton Tower, with easy subway access."
635,Joe K,None,None,29-October-2019,"We were at the Canton Fair and took the metro to visit this restaurant 3 times in 5 days, the dim sum was that good.
It is very easy to find, take Exit A at Canton Tower metro station and walk under the covered area under the tower, it is beside the tea place.

Staff were very helpful, not many could speak English but they tried to use translation tools to understand. The owner is called Paul and he can speak perfect English if you get stuck.

Also, most of the menu has photos and all have English names, every dish that we tried was excellent.

You must try the red cargo rolls, just amazing taste."

Not as expensive as the ones on the tower, but I guess the experience would be similar, expect for the view. I went there alone and ordered five dishes. To my surprise, the clerk came and advised me to cancel two of them because that might be too much for only one person. I was really happy that they care for customers rather than making money. The dishes were really good. I had a great time having dinner there.
廣通塔上有許多高級餐廳，但如果想找間平價又實惠的，賞點點心是不錯的選擇，就在廣通塔底下，很好找。我當時一個人用餐，點了五道菜。很訝異店員來告訴我是不是刪除兩道，不然可能對一個人用餐來說太多了。很開心相對於商業利益，店員們更在乎客人的感受。在這裡點的每道菜都很好吃，我在這裡有頓很棒的晚餐！"

Reasonable prices too."
644,Tubbydubs,Singapore,Singapore,27-June-2018,"Shang Dian lists over 90 items on its menu. While there may be places in Guangzhou serving better dim sum, Shang Dian did not disappoint with it's fresh ingredients and competently executed dishes at pocket-friendly prices. The restaurant at Canton Tower is easily accessible by the metro, staff members are friendly and helpful,and food comes quickly and nicely plated. We usually order the usual pau, rice rolls, har kow etc, all of which were good. We ventured to order the red cargo rice roll and it was TRULY enjoyable! Don't let the pic in their menu scare you - its way better than it looks! The har kow (prawn dumplings) were huge and had 3 springy prawns in each yummy morsel. We ate there in the late afternoon so there was no crowd, though there was a constant trickle of diners. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal there despite having to brave torrential rains and flood.

The fried egg noodle rice roll was our favorite, and the garlic and shrimp dumplings.

Great Cantonese food, efficient and impeccable service, even the place was flooded with overflow convention folks during our visits. Especially loved their steamed fish and dim sum. Your clients would love you meeting here instead of at the convention center!"

When I received the first dish the waitress informed me that they didn't have any of the wines. They didn't suggest anything instead and no sommelier in hand. The first plate a shrimp overcooked and a yellow sauce starting to get cold. Second plate a fish with something white under with no flavor. Third dish a overcooked and tough rib. The rice was ok. No one took the time to explain what I was eating. Service very  amusement park restaurant . Surprise that they have a Michelin star."
670,demandingp,None,None,22-May-2017,"Locating inside a 5 star hotel but the price is affordable. Guangzhou is a place where you can found traditional Chinese food easily along the street but sometime sitting inside a nice and decent restaurant giving you a confident feeling about the food quality."
671,youke_worldwide,Singapore,None,13-April-2017,"This Chinese restaurant was great and they also had a lot of private rooms in order for us to have a nice business lunch. The food ordered was designed to impress. When the soup came in, it was served in a big old style pot flowing with dry ice and being carried by two men and a lady to bang the gong. The bowls of soup were inside. Another excellent dish was the pencai that had every special kind of delicacy. They also served this special chicken that was brought up only on sunflower seed - the farm only serves a maximum of 200 chicken a day which is why the chicken is suppose to be so special - personally I found the ginger sauce that accompanied it a bit too salty. All in all, the venue atmosphere and the food were all designed to impress and would recommend it any day."
672,Ana L,None,None,19-March-2017,"Had a quick lunch prior to departure after a two-night stay last September, comparable dim-sum dishes with its Hong Kong counterpart, service could be a bit better, kind of slow and the lack of knowledge is not quite acceptable with five-star hotel restaurants."
673,LamN_12,None,None,15-March-2017,"Delectable Cantonese, attentive service, classy ambience (with private room if you so need). However, the chefs don't seem to take enough risks, as they don't offer many innovative dishes as at several other Shangri-La Summer Palace or Seventh Son restaurants, at least on the menu."
674,D-Orlovsky,None,None,17-September-2016,"My parents came to visit in China and we have been traveling around in Shenzhen, Donguan, Xiamen , Hk and finished in Guangzhou. Had visit in so many restaurants but there was one worth to mention!
We stayed in shangerila hotel( that was amazing by itself) and I wanted them to have a taste of the high end Chinese cuisine- summer palace was chosen.
We ordered 1 day before the Peking duck and a table for 4 in a private room.
In the entrance of the restaurant we met Sobriya and Rebecca that welcomed us with big smiles and showed us the way to the private room.
We chose a jasmine tea that had great smell and taste to accompany our meal.
The first dishes came fast and were a great opening for what to come.
All the dishes that arrived to the table were remarkably perfect ( shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, cold radish and mushrooms , fried pork with vegetables ) but none of them could prepare us for the Peking duck!!!- it was the best one I have ever had!!!! - way of presentation ,skilled cutting, taste of gravy and meat, rice papers, fresh vegetables , second phase of cooking on the wok!!! Wow!!!!
The last course before desert was a symbolic dumplings birds cage that was very beautiful and not less tasty!
Sobriya and Rebecca keep visiting us 3 more times during the 2 hours meal and keep making sure that we are satisfied and all is for our taste. As it was the mid autumn festival, we received as well a great taste of the hotel's moon cakes as complimentary:)
The desert of fruit soup with mango and a sweet snow ball stuffed with cream was refreshing and a perfect finish for this amazing meal!
Its not cheap at all but for an exceptional experience in China worth every cent!"

679,rhiat,San Jose,California,8-November-2014,"I always try to go back to Summer Palace for dim sum each time I visit Guangzhou. I love every single things on the dim sum menu.

They had some choices although we get lot more dishes in India in a comparable Chinese restaurant
Generally we assumed Chinese hospitality demanded a welcome tea.They neither offered nor served until we reminded of it
Food was good and the experience of spending an hour there was memorable

However on the way to this restaurant few notorious boys wooed selling of spurious apple iPhones of latest S6 and cheated on the way .These guys show a working model and delivered dummy show window non working pieces.
Shangrila being a pride of China can have a vigilance on these activities and prevent these mischievous acts on the way near the entrance"

And the dinner at Summer Palace confirmed the high praise that they deserve
We rented a private room where there is a minimum fee of 600 rmb per person and in a complete
privacy we have been submitted an extraordinary range of dishes with top noth vegetables, amazing and spicy king prawns, delicacy as jelly fish , a smooth and tender cd, perfectly braised beef ribs, crispy duck skins , master made fried rice, a sort of cake made by fried vermicelli and mushrooms , and superbe
scallops . None of us five left less than happy to have shared a great Chinese experience in a nice seeting and with prompt service"
686,pendol123,Sydney,Australia,27-January-2014,"Being the only Chinese restaurant in Shangri-la Guangzhou it obviously had to be good. I was not disappointed. This restaurant is perfect for a westerner compared to other local offerings due to its fine dishes and small portions offered allowing diners to enjoy a lot of different dishes. Service was excellent with attendants filling your cup and teapot every 5 minutes or so. Not much view can be seen from this restaurant at night because it's basically pitch black outside. Small dining area compared to other Chinese restaurants in Guangzhou therefore they may be a wait if you arrive during a peak period like ~7:00pm. Exceptionally busy during Canton Fair of course."
687,rhiat,San Jose,California,28-June-2013,"It is so hard to find a Dim Sum place that offers the authentic taste and menu selection, and good quality of food at the same time now in Guangzhou. I'm so glad we found Summer Palace in Shangri-La.

Everything is served fresh, and they use good quality ingredient, and plenty of them as it should be. For example, unlike other restaurants that serve Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice with Chicken that only has a feel pieces of chicken in it, Summer Palace serve the original Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice with all the great ingredient: chicken, mushroom, dried shrimp, dried scallop, salty egg yolk... They also serve their Durian tart with real Durian in them, instead of Durian flavor that most other dim sum place do.

Very nice atmosphere. Not bad service."

We definitely wouldn’t recommend eating there for dinner."
692,Paisan P,Gulf Shores,Alabama,8-May-2019,"We truly enjoyed our dining experience. The service was excellent, and the food was very good. The steamed fish and the dim sum were the big hits at our table. The beef curry and the roast pork were also very good. The service and quality of the food is what one would expect."

Great staff and wonderful service!

Worth a visit!

696,EvelynneG,Melbourne,Australia,3-May-2018,"Three of us went for lunch after working and found the restaurant quite busy. Everything we ordered was delicious and top quality except for our Beef Fois Gras and Truffles. There was NO Fois Gras OR
Truffles. When we told our waiter he went away & came back a few minutes later. He said the Chef definitely put both Truffle & Fois Gras. To which I answered that it was absolutely nowhere to be tasted & I had eaten Truffle & Fois Gras last night so that I was fully aware of what they tasted like
After much argument he agreed to a 10% discount on the dish. That was not the point there was definitely none of those ingredients in that dish even though the chef said there was. I wonder what happened to the saying that the customer is always right.
It did spoil what was otherwise a delicious meal"
697,feleciab2013,Tangerang,Indonesia,1-May-2018,"Well I don't really know how to said a real Cantonese Chinese food or not. But the foods are delicious. I had a business trip and my company's owner invited us to had dinner here. They served steamed fish (big one), beef curry, enoki mushroom with beef, grill prawn, and some other foods. Compare to other restaurant in Guangzhou, this Cantonese Foods are tasty, had a good serving for sure, and the place is very clean."

700,118purpleh,London,United Kingdom,6-December-2017,"This hotel is located at a very good location with amazing views, but , the rooms could be better , they seem old , they need to be modern , they don’t smell good ! I wish the rooms had the same smell as the reception!! The toilets need to change ! When the water flushes everything comes up before going down ! Not a good look ! The WiFi in the rooms is poor ! The rooms are so big, spacious and all I will give them that , but for WESTIN I feel it could look better , put more decorations in the rooms like wall pictures ! Modern lamp shades , better wall paper ! But the staff at the executive lounge are amazing !! I give them a 5 star! So helpful and always pay attention to detail , so professional! The views frm there are to die for too ! Above all it’s an ok hotel but needs to improve ! Oh and also help more with calling taxis for customers , porters tend to b rare when needed !"
701,WWTraveller26,Singapore,Singapore,26-March-2015,"The all you can eat buffet is priced attractively but remember the portions ate small and there might be a lot of items you don't like. As an outsider well versed with Chinese food,u would still pass the Beef tripe and the chicken feet. You must pave the order all at once because they shut the kitchen at 2 and then after that it's very hard to get even noodles out. I wouldn't say the food is outstanding, but it's a decent price for so much dim sum."
702,Chun pang L,None,None,29-November-2014,"I made the reservation for 2 with my wife celebrating her birthday in the Chinese Restaurant of this 5 star rated hotel. Despite reserved table, we were not served properly, and just casually put at table without well served attended. It's also surprising that my wife ordered 4 dishes, and 3 we're not available without remark and still shown on menu. Even we asked waiter what's else available from menu, the response was slow and unclear. It's very disappointing to me, in particular for is really want to give my wife a little bit surprise with good food, good ambience to celebrate her birthday, but just turn up the other way!"

Absolutely delicious! with amazing attentive customer service -the waitress were constantly refilling our tea with a beautiful Chinese tea set that my partner and I ended up purchasing from the restaurant. There were a few vegetarian dishes my partner could select from. We recommend the Shredded Bean Curd with Sesame & Ginger, Chef's Special of Roast Pork, Pork Belly Hot Pot and the Oolong Tea. Also, the All-You-Can eat Yum Cha for ¥138 per person is highly recommended! The dim sum and the lobster brisk soup is amazing! We look forward to staying at The Westin and dining at Hong Mian again."

Service is ok, but one of the waitress has very very bad body odour. The smell could be felt as she walked pass. I had told her to stay away or get some deodorant. After complaining to the manager many times, they decided to move her to the kitchen, but the damage has been done, and she destroyed my lunch!
Strangely, the hotel refuse to make reservation for the restaurant on behalf of guests, they insisted I make the reservation directly with the restaurant. I'm not sure if the hotel actually runs the restaurant."

708,DaCoerrrm,None,None,26-April-2019,"If you want legit, clean Hong Kong-style comfort food, then Wuu's is the best place to go in Guangzhou. Many locals argue that it's overpriced and not authentic, but I'd completely disagree. It's the only place if you want late-night Dim Sum (the best time to eat it). Nearly everything on the mega-extensive menu is decent, It's not cheap, but reassuringly-expensive."
709,wesleywaisiu,Singapore,Singapore,15-March-2019,"Walk by this place and try to enjoy some nice Hong Kong food. There are a lot of variety and the quality of the food is the same as those in HK. But the egg waffle is a bit disappointed, over cook and empty in the middle.
There are a lot of menus for different kind of food. Make sure you study all before you order"

714,pvandeven,Sydney,Australia,11-November-2016,"Our first visit to Guangzhou and we were much looking forward to the tiny delights of dim sum. Other reviewers had given this restaurant the highest of ratings so we were salivating. Over more than 20 years of visiting China from Yunnan and Sichuan to Beijing and Shanghai and numerous other places in cities and in the the countryside between, I had not had a disappointing meal. But here was a first. Pedestrian yum cha in an equally mediocre setting! Enough said. There are a million good places to eat in Guangzhou ... give this one a miss and sate your dim sum appetite once you get to Hong Kong. PS: What were the previous reviewers thinking? Had they ever tasted quality dim sum? I doubt it."

I came here two continuously night for my dinner, cause choices is too much a stomach is too little to fit in most yummy food that make me drooling.

order whatever your stomach is calling for. if not sure just pick those with picture. ( Menu in chinese english japanese word ) I took more than 5min to read the whole menu :p

This authentic cha can ting (HK cafe shop) is really worth to go for feed your hunger."
717,SaraS5534,None,None,6-October-2016,"We have frequented Wuu's many times over the past two years, and it is consistently the best dim sum we've found in Guangzhou. They have a vast picture menu, which allows those without Chinese language skills to point and order, and gives lots of variety. Their BBQ pork buns are amazing as are their pineapple buns. The sesame rice rolls, turnip cakes with xo sauce, and shrimp dumplings are also must orders."
718,Nansbubs,Perth,Australia,3-September-2016,"We arrived and asked for Dim Sum for dinner, but were lead away to the hotspot section in a private dining room, I assume because they thought that this is what foreigners want. After solving the confusion, we were pointed back to where we came from. We then enjoyed a nice meal from the Chinese and Englich menus with pictures. I have had just as good a meal in Australia, but enjoyed it nonetheless. Th e restaurant was very busy for dim sum in the evening, which is always a good sign. We had to queue on chairs outside, so you know that the food is fresh and it was very tasty."

720,Kay B,Heidelberg,Germany,8-August-2016,"Just tried this place and must say: awesome one! There are so many different dishes to choose from... unbeliveable. I went here without reservation and so I had to wait for some minutes outside in the heat. But as soon as I got a table I was just delighted. I took just two dumplings as I was eating on my own. That was more than enough already. They basically serve everything and it seems that the menu almost never ends. The rates for the dishes are just fair. I highly recommend this place, especially for groups!"
721,vorakornc,Bangkok,Thailand,22-June-2016,"The restaurant is a short walk down the street from Tai Koo mall/Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou in the underground level of a building strips. The stair leading to Woo's can be enter from walkpath (in front of Starbucks). Apparently there are 2 sides of the restaurant, Woo's restaurant is on the right with seating both indoor and outdoor.

My friend and I went there for lunch on Sunday, their menu cover large amount of dishes from congee, bbq duck, clay pot, noodles, milk tea to dim sum. I got to try a little bit of everything. Congee was quite decent, just like their dim sum, but the rest fall below Guangzhou's high standard, not bad but not as good as other  good  places.

The decor of the cafe is very colorful and charming, perfect start for any day, probably best thing about the place!!"
722,SuinaKnows,Irvine,California,9-May-2016,"HK style cafe, huge menu, fast, and consistent in taste. I always order the classic tomato sauce porkchop baked rice. It is always served hot with tender pieces of porkchop, and flavorful tomato sauce. Otherwise, their HK style roast meats are also very good. Great meal on a budget. They also have classic Cantonese style hearty soup for nutrition replenishment."

There are 2 restaurant when you go down the stairs outside
We went to the one on the right which offers dim sum (the other one doesn't)
Very good as you can see on the pictures
We loved it and price was ok (200 yuans for 9 different plates and drinks)
We definitely strongly recommend
Thanks Wu's"
724,tulipanmorado,None,None,24-December-2015,"Located few block away from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the restaurant served hotpot, dessert, dimsum, noodle. And they opened from 9am to 3am. Hence it's good for breakfast to supper. Price are reasonable. Definitely recommended"
725,ahbai1976,Singapore,Singapore,26-November-2015,"food menu is definitely extensive with lotsa varieties. but sad to say the dishes I ordered which is typically Cantonese specialty is only average and nothing to shout about. the price is also not cheap compared to some other old famous restaurants in Guangzhou.

but if you are looking for wide varieties, this is the place for you. the only saving grace was the ice milk tea which is considered better."
726,kalapangha,New York City,New York,1-November-2015,"Love HK milk tea here. It's very concentrated and not sweet.

This placed served all day dim sum but menu items could be limited. The yellow dumplings in the picture is shark fin, I know I shouldn't have ordered but it tastes the best among their dim sum. Chiw Chow dumpling is kinda fishy to me. Roasted goose has a lot of bones. Congee we could get better back in NYC. Overall I think it's overhyped or we just did not order enough food to try."
727,alvinloy,None,None,31-October-2015,"Ambience: Typical Hong Kong style  tea restaurant . Nothing fancy.

Waiting time: I arrived at the restaurant on a Saturday evening. Had to take a queue number as they do not accept reservations. We waited for about 30 minutes.

Choices: Wow. The variety of the menu is astounding, from breads to savory Canton dishes to hotspot to soups to desserts.

Recommendations:
Ice Milk Tea: I love it! The flavor is rich and the aroma of the tea lingers in your mouth. Gentle warning: It is really strong.
Shark's fin soup: It is really cheap but I don't think there is any shark's fin in it, just lots of vermicelli. Tastes average.
Roasted goose and barbecue pork (char siew): Roasted goose is always my favorite dish in Guangdong province. At Woo's, roasted to perfection with a crispy skin but still maintaining a juicy succulent meat.
Po Lo bun: One of the best Po Lo buns I have ever tasted. The slab of butter in the middle melts in your mouth when you sink your teeth in the crispy sweet crust. Best consumed when it's hot. Can't help myself to order a second one but it was sold out!
Choi sum with garlic: I still don't understand why Cantonese people enjoy vegetables in such a bland way. All I can say it that you can tastes the  freshness  of the vegetables at Woo's.

Summary: A no-frills restaurant with an extensive menu. Food quality is good and prices are fairly cheap. This place is good for all occasions any time of the day."
728,nikkinhuang,None,None,15-October-2015,"Love this place. The setting is much more homely and original than most other yum cha places in town. The food is wonderful, they have some unique specialties on the menu and it always comes out very quickly."

first of all, the environment is quite good, old HK style, lots of car/bus model there, which my son loves them. the location of restaurant if quite convenience, easy to access.
yet the food quality is just a little bit over average, which do not over the expection.
btw, I'm a cantonese and living in Guangzhou for over 30 years, these foods are available in most of HK fast food restaurant."
732,FiddlingTravelNotes,None,None,26-November-2014,"It was good to be back after 2 months. Just discovered that seating is faster when dining alone as the restaurant has a shared table. Had razor clams in black bean sauce which was good and sesame walnuts which is a winner."
733,donal_sharkey,Brighton,UK,30-September-2014,"We really struggled to find this place, but when we did it was well worth it. The food was brilliant, fresh and available until 3am!

If you go here you have to try the clams in black bean sauce & the pork belly.

We ate here 3 times in 5 days.

Would love to go back."

Would definitely recommend any of the meat/veggie on rice dishes or any of the noodles. The congee was pretty good as well. Clams with black beans reminded me of my favorite late night Chinese place in New York; first time I've had a good version of this dish in GZ. Bilingual menu, so you can choose and point. Protip: they have chilled porcelain bowls to drink your beer out of if you know how to ask."
738,MarlonBata,None,None,26-April-2014,"I always eat here whenever I'm in GZ and I'm billeted in Ascott. It's the best Chinese food I've tried in GZ. What's more, they're open til 2am. This is a definite must when in GZ."
739,budir79,None,None,24-April-2014,"I don't think this place is good. but the atmosphere is ok. The staff cannot understand english. And the good one, the menu is billingual english-chinese."
740,wtanujaya,Makassar,Indonesia,24-April-2014,"We arrived around noon during weekend, and the restaurant was full, so we had to wait. They made the floor and interior looks old. We ordered several items recommended by the server, and it turned out to be awesome. The chinese soup, and roasted items were great, as expected for a delicious cantonese food. The service on the restaurant is not that good though, they don't have designated server for the table. If you don;t call them, they will not come to you even though the glass is empty"
741,Andrew_Alin,Greater Adelaide,Australia,7-March-2014,"This is a solid choice for a quick dimsum meal. Most of the favourites you'd see outside of china are there, plus many small plates you'd only get in china. We got pork intestines 2 different ways, both were yummy. The usual chicken feet, short ribs, rice nodle rolls, amd assorted dumplings and buns.

Yummy food, good value. Recommended."
742,Andrew_Alin,None,None,4-February-2014,"Great for a late dinner. We had the a braised intestines dish, and some wonton noodles. Both were yummy, with good flavours. Will be back again to try the dim sum for lunch next time."
743,Feeyona,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,16-January-2014,"This was the first dim sum restaurant I patronised when I visited Guangzhou. As I was staying nearer towards the Hai Zhu metro station area, I had to switch to a few different metro lines which took around 30mins-1hour before reaching the restaurant. But if you dont mind spending time travelling from the city to this area, you can head to Shipaiqiao (Line 3) metro station and get off from there. The restaurant is situated nearby the Mandarin Oriental hotel, and Tai Koo Hui shopping mall, at a basement below Starbucks. Just look out for the MO hotel (use it as a landmark) and walk towards that direction and you'll soon see the TKH shopping mall as you walk closer. The walk will take you around 5-10mins from the metro station. The next thing to look out for is Starbucks and you'll be able to spot the restaurant located just below it.

The dim sums were pretty good and worth a try especially the pork dumpling with quail egg. I like the porridges as well. Not the cheapest dim sum around but quality wise, it's worth the money you pay."
744,mrctlim,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,19-December-2013,"Wuu's comprises 3 outlets and offers an immense range of HK favourites. from roast pork/duck/goose, wanton noodles, variety of stir fried dishes, innards of various birds and mammals (nicely braised) to hot pot and desserts. Also the very important milk tea. Prices are restaurant levels though, but the environment is better than the average  char chan teng  to justify that, I suppose."
745,JesyHitesh,Bangalore District,India,2-December-2013,"Not very many good eating joints in gaungzhou are open so late ...when we went we realized by the people waiting this is good place ...good choice of food ...good service ...
the prices were also very reasonable given the choice of the place . a recommended place for sure"
746,Quanchanok R,None,None,8-November-2013,"Visit here after read the review! Make sure u have Chinese friends or your hotel concierge know the location, it's at basement below Starbucks!! Great dim sum, and Milk Tea is not to be missed!"
747,SirGuyGisborne,None,None,7-November-2013,"Lovely freshly produced food served in a casual relaxing atmosphere. Dim Sum was delicious. The menu has pictures of the dishes which is just as well as my cantonese is a little rusty."
748,adferious,London,None,27-October-2013,"We were in Guangzhou for 12 hours and rushed here after reading the reviews. Having been to Hong Kong before I was just expecting just excellent dim sum, but in truth this place was incredible. The range of dishes is huge but every one is cooked to perfection. In particular I'd recommend the quail egg and pork dumplings, as well as the black bean chicken noodles.

The staff don't speak any English, and I was subsequently embarrassed by my lack of Chinese skills as well. But the menu is in English and has pictures, and we managed to work through. As others have said, the service is no frills, but that's the point.

We ordered an obscene amount of food, it was all amazing, and very cheap. If I go to Guangzhou again I'll be back to Wuu's in a heartbeat."
749,thomas61416,None,None,14-October-2013,"I was so happy my friend in Guangzhou took me to this restaurant, we ate like 10 different Dim Sum and everyone was delicious, the service was O.K. and the price was reasonable, highly recommend this restaurant to everybody!"
750,Jonathan B,Bangkok,None,30-September-2013,"This is a highly-rated restaurant, and it lives up to its reputation. The food is excellent with a huge variety offered. This is the best Cantonese food I've had in China (not including Hong Kong.)

The wait can be quite long from 6 PM until very late, so if you are in a hurry, try to get there before then."
751,pilou17,Guangzhou,None,15-July-2013,"What a restaurant!! I've been in GZ for about a year with my girlfriend, and we've been there sooo many times!!!

Every time we want to eat good food, no hesitation! Fair price, very convenient to go (just nearby the Mandarin Oriental hotel, and Tai Koo Hui shopping mall, in the underground below Starbucks), and the food is just delicious. They're open from morning to late in the evening, and don't get me wrong, what a better sign of quality in China that having a restaurant full all day long, every single day of the week??

You can take away if you don't want to wait, but usually for a table of your own (you can share with other people to have a seat faster if you like) inside, you may have to wait for 20 or 30 minutes. Just make sure to know it before you go, to not lose your patience while waiting.

Once inside, everything is very easy! Menus are with plenty of pictures and also written in English, price are in the average of a Chinese restaurant, and the quality!! Food is just crazy!! Their noodles, rice, dim sums, dumplings, buns, everything is good! Try what seems nice to you, you won't regret it!

Beers are cheap, milk tea is just awesome, Coke is rmb10.... what else do you need!
They bring you food quickly, kitchen is just crazy. You've no chance to get some old rotten food, they serve so many client per day!

I don't remember seeing such busy restaurant...

But watch out, you're in a typical Chinese place, not in a chineseforforeigner restaurant or so. Don't expect anyone to know one word of English, or to pay attention to service. This restaurant is the definition of what Guangdong people want about their restaurant: high food quality, no need of service!
However, no worries you'll have the attention of the waiters, they've got plenty of them keeping their heads up ready to jump to your table to take your next order.

In one word, enjoy you meal, this is great food :)
If you want to experience a great food/Chinese atmosphere, you'll remember it for long!!"
752,PushExplore,None,None,26-May-2019,"We had quite a nice experience dining here. The place is really beautiful and the food is quite flavorful and delicious."
753,Telly H,None,None,25-August-2018,"Congee and Chinese Kale were excellent. Some interesting items too, tasted good too. Service staff were attentive, friendly and helpful, especially Jason and Linda"
754,DanielL12319,None,None,26-October-2017,"Sorely disappointed with our visit to yan yu. Perhaps our expectations were raised with the positive reviews online and it being sited in a W Hotel.

The pricing and the attempt at reinterpreting shun tuck cuisine falls flat. I happen to like shun tuck cuisine and have tried a few. But this feels like a cheap imitation. Nothing like the inventiveness of Bo Innovation in Hong Kong, which surprises the senses and forces the mind to recalibrate its experience with the dish.

To be fair to the team, as in all things W, the smell, ambience, presentation and service was impeccable; befitting the W branding.

But ultimately, the food disappoints."
755,Pa E,None,None,27-May-2017,"I enjoyed the Chinese restaurant cuisines; the dim sum is excellent! Our chinese friend and host also regularly enjoy the food here. Contemporary design."
756,thespgtraveler,Chiang Mai,Thailand,25-December-2016,"I love Chinese food, but probably more so the western style Chinese food that you typically have outside of China. Probably because I am not so adventurous when it comes to Chinese food. We only dined at Yan Yu once during our stay at the W Guangzhou, but the food was fabulous. The menu had most of my favourite cantonese dishes on it. The chef cooked at our table which was a nice treat. Superb dishes, Wok Fried noodles, and wok fried Angus tenderloin. Great dining experience."
757,Vincent S,None,None,1-November-2016,"I live in Guangzhou and I go quite often to W guangzhou to eat and have a drink. The woo bar is a good place to chill, with a good cocktail list. I love their cocktail  botanic elixir . Delicious and original. I strongly recommend their Chinese restaurant, Yan Yu. Their all you can dim sum is excellent!"
758,petere903,None,None,18-October-2016,"Great Chinese in modern W style room. Awsome well done W A special thank you to Stone our waiter, great service and knowledge of food and wine."
759,Altitude66,Manila,Philippines,3-April-2015,"Our group chose this restaurant because of the reviews on trip advisor. This is not exactly the run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant. Of course, it being in a W Hotel makes you expect a modern twist. The interior has pleasant cool floral accents. And a sight to see is the classy but elaborate mirrored bathroom. I recommend the roast suckling pig with foie gras and the abalone soup. Truly a memorable dinner experience."
760,cj_halvo62,Perth,Australia,7-January-2015,"The food here is quite good, albeit probably not what you're used to if a Westerner, and a modern interpretation of Chinese cuisine.

The decor is very contemporary, which should come as no surprise as part of the W Hotel chain, and didn't offer a 'truly authentic' ambience.

Many Australian wines on the list (I'm an Aussie so that's good) and the service was very good.

If what you're after is a meal with 'different' Chinese food, this place is for you but if you want the 'Chinese experience' perhaps it's not the place."
761,NGLS26,None,None,29-July-2019,"i had in the BeiJing Road branch restaurant, the atmosphere of the restaurant not really good. But the Ciong Fen is very good."
762,bcolohan,Cincinnati,Ohio,28-April-2019,"The lead woman was very helpful and patient. The menu is all Chinese and she knew basic words like beef and shrimp. That helped. Then I was able to point to the rice congee to get a bowl of that. I think the experience was as good as it could be for a cheap eats establishment. The shrimp and beef rice noodles I ordered were only 25 yuan for both and the congee was 13 yuan. I was solo so it was no problem getting a chair at a table. The whole area is bustling. There is a Buddhist wat right around the corner from the restaurant you ought to check out. Definitely pay a visit."
763,joshuaalex383,None,None,16-April-2019,"Delicious, soft and silky cheong fen made on the spot and served immediately. Yummy. Service was fast and place clean"
764,sweepengchan2016,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,30-March-2019,"This little eatery is packed with customers as early as 08.30hrs. Don't hope to have a table to yourself. I shared the table with 4 others and it's well accepted. They offer a variety of Cheong Fun肠粉and rice congee稀饭/粥. Be prepared to wait at least 20 mins for your orders as each plate or bowl is cooked separately. I ordered a plate of mixed pork and beef cheong fun and a bowl of salted pork bone congee. All served pipping hot and yummy."
765,PushExplore,None,None,13-February-2019,"We ate lunch at this typical local restaurant. The rice rolls and the dumplings were quite nice. If you like local food, then this place would be a good experience. The food is not that expensive either."
766,mantingh2018,None,None,5-February-2019,"Rice rolls and porridge are so tasty. Just simple orders are good enough. Don't go with complicated options. Classics are the best."
767,MANDACHEN,Selangor,Malaysia,13-December-2018,"This rice noodle rolls restaurant are in many places like McD and KFC, decent taste and price. Many varieties too. We had the seafood porridge and seafood  cheong fun , the taste is so good and I don't think they added MSG too because I don't feel thirsty after eating it."
768,TuangWX,None,None,13-December-2018,"Had char siew cheong fun and it was good, actually return to have it again before back home, taste yummy! Steam milk and Gui ling gao are good too whereas porridge taste so so"
769,leonac435,None,None,19-July-2018,"Finally there’s a branch here in Singapore and must I say how I missed their Rice Roll also known as Chang Feng in Chinese. Different fillings to choose from and it’s exactly the smooth texture you get in China. Dumplings was filled and tasty too."
770,okla26,Johor,None,24-April-2018,"I would say food was OK, if it is just base on food review, i would go back.

But... , they  ASK  us to leave when we are yet to finish our drink, as someone is waiting for the indoor table (aircon), but outside tables are still have a lot empty... ???? Is this good service to you? I would think twice to go back."
771,HappyTravelerSarah,Singapore,Singapore,30-September-2017,"This old restaurant offers the authentic Chinese rice rolls. Nothing fanciful just the humble store offering rice rolls with different meat, prawns, mushrooms and fillings. They also offer porridge and noodles. It's certainly worth a try if you pass by the many branches of Yin Ji Chang Fen."
772,Montie Y,None,None,30-July-2017,"We ate a lot before this meal. That's why we only ordered the rice rolls. One signature, one three-combo (三寶) and one with black truffle for six people. This is one of the best rich rolls I have ever tried. Yet, the price is affordable and the place is generally tidy."
773,Wendyzhou,Sydney,Australia,26-March-2017,"The rice rolls here are amazing! We tried the pork liver, beef, pork and mushroom and fish. The menu is in Chinese but if you know your classic rolls and can speak abit of broken Chinese you will be fine. Everything is so cheap (especially compared to Australian prices). I didn't really like the beef stew, congee and the fried bread sticks weren't fresh. My advice is stick to what they are famous for which are the rice rolls!"
774,Kathleen_Leong,None,None,2-January-2017,"We ordered congee and 鲜虾粉肠 Food was excellent and highly recommended for breakfast. The restaurant open whole day."
775,kmb97,None,None,9-March-2015,"This is the shop that i will stop by every time i visit GZ. Highly recommended! But Weekend might be quite full, but worth to try out! Congee and 腸粉 are essential! 這是我將每一次我訪問GZ店。 強烈推薦！但週末可能是相當多人，但值得嘗試！ 粥和腸粉是必不可少的！ 雖然他們是連鎖店，但是店質量不同."
776,489natalyaz,None,None,12-January-2019,"Good restaurant with unique dishes like the bird nest soup, shark soup, a lot if choices for the abalone, really unique place with the normal prices. We will be visiting during our next Vancouver trip."
777,vorakornc,Bangkok,Thailand,19-June-2018,"The restaurant is located on 3rd floor of Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel. I went there on Sunday for lunch. I had the duck ordered when I made reservation, so the duck was ready when i arrived 11am. Waitress said it would take about 50 minutes for the duck without advance order, so consider this if you have plan afterward.

The dishes itself is just marvelous. Duck skin was evenly roasted and it fluffed up to about 2mm of crispy goodness. It took no effort from the chef in removing the skin as it was already separated from meat and fat during roast. The dish is served with duck meat, chinese pancake, and some basic peking duck condiments. I asked for the remainder of the duck to be cooked in casserole with bitter melon (recommended by the host). Though the condiment and additional dishes were good and above standard already, the roasted skin of the duck lift Yue restaurant to a different league of its own. Definitely one of the best.

Though it annoys me a bit that servers in a 5 stars hotel restaurant like this cannot speak English, so every time i need to communicate I had to call out for restaurant host and wait a while. The english speaking host were great though."
778,TheHappyCamper2013,None,None,9-October-2017,"A well designed, somewhat overstaffed place with a view. Liked by Chinese, many locals. Good dim sum, served very Chinese! Typically appreciation for quality ingredients"
779,billpar2015,Orange,Australia,26-August-2017,"As we were staying at the Sheraton we thought we would try Yue based on recommendations on Trip Advisor.
Of the five dishes we ordered four were very average at best but the fried rice was an epic fail and barely edible and smelled of very old rancid fat or oil.
I wouldn't be wasting time and money here. The restaurant options in Tee Mall next door to the hotel are much better options"
780,Karmaexplorer,Melbourne,Australia,12-July-2017,"The restaurant was promoting Peking duck at the time of my visit. This is one of my favourite Chinese foods and I of course would not miss it. It also served delectable spicy fish. If you like dim sum, you should pay a visit here too. I came to the restaurant everytime when I visited Guangzhou.

Staff were very attentive and helpful. This went from trainee to manager. The restaurant manager must have provided an effective customer service training to her staff."
781,glnomad,None,None,24-October-2015,"Little to fault abt the food - we had dinner and chose the chef specials. Delicious, gd portion (a little heavy) but otherwise of gd quality. We thought service can be more welcoming and friendly."
